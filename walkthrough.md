## 1. The idea

Have you ever opened your fridge and not known what to prepare? Re-Fridgerate is an app that will sort this problem. 
With the fridge of the future in mind as a final iteration (if that even exists!), I created a recommender in which the user enters the ingredients he has on his fridge and it returns a few recipes he/she could make with those ingredients.

## 2. Minimum Viable Product

The MVP should be able to:
+ Get three ingredients from the user
+ Check if there are recipes in our database that contain those ingredients
+ Return a few recipes with the best sentiment score


## 3. Methodology

First, I created a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/YjeBv569/final-project) to plan all the tasks and subtasks i would need to take care off.

The main idea was to use three different fundamental skills: Web Scraping, EDA, Cleaning & Wrangling and Sentiment Analysis

1. I Web Scraped allrecipes.com using BeautifulSoup. I first tested scraping just one page, and i was able to get the fields i wanted - Recipe Title, Category and Subcategory, Ingredients, Reviews and URL. After realising that there was a number in the url that if increased by one would jump into a new page with a new recipe, I thought i could scrape for multiple recipes by creating a loop. In order to do this, i would need to define a function first with all the individual parts i had used before to scrape the test page that also inserts the restults into a dataframe. This function would be called later on with a while loop. I was able to get data for 1045 recipes.

2. EDA, Cleaning & Wrangling:
+ Checking for nulls, data types, number of rows and columns
+ converting everything to lower
+ removing unnamed column
+ cleaning ingredients: converting to list, tokenizing, keeping only alpha values, removing reserved words
+ Exploring Category and Subcategory in a bit more detail

3. I performed Sentiment Analysis over the customer reviews, with the objective of storing this information in a new column of our dataframe so the recommender would return the best scoring recipes. First i performed sentiment analysis over reviews from one recipe only as a test. I then cleaned the reviews by removing punctuation signs, tokenized them using NLTK to then remove stopwords and finally performed the sentiment analysis.
