Some modifications: I\'d use flour tortillas, and definitely a small can of green chiles for flavor (green chiles are not hot, just flavorful), and I would use pinto beans instead. I would also add about 4 oz of sour cream in with the other ingredients (you can do this with almost any recipe that calls for cream of mushroom soup). In addition to adding flavor, it also keeps it from being ""dry"" as one person mentioned. Another way to keep it from getting dry would be to use a teaspoon or two of the juices from each ingredient (tomatoes, chiles, beans). ', ' This is excelent dish. I followed other reviewers suggestions and add almost 1/2 envelope of taco seasoning to beef, sautee one medium onion while browning meat, used 1/2 tsp of chilli powder (i do not like spicy food) and added small can of mushrooms. I put a very thin layer of meat mixture on the bottom of pan and put cheese on all the layers. I also sprinkled jalapenos peppers on half of the dish to spicy it up for my husband. I served it with the choice of sour cream and salsa. We both really enjoyed it. Thanks. ', ' This recipe turned out really well. I gave it four stars because as my husband would say, ""I tweeked it some"". I have to admit, at first I was a little hesitant to put cream of mushroom soup in a mexican casserole, but it was good. I did use Ranch Style Beans, I believe that they add a certain flavor that only they can add. I have many recipes using Ranch Beans and I am grateful that they are a common staple in South Texas. I used a can of Rotel tomatoes and I used flour tortillas. I ommited the chili powder and instead used a half a packet of taco seasoning. I browned the ground beef with onion and then seasoned it with Tony\'s (I put that in everything!) and garlic powder. I did as others suggested and put a small amount of meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, then layered the tortillas then meat then cheese, then repeated the layers once more. I also don\'t measure cheese, I just add what looks good, but I probably used approximately 2 cups instead of the 4 that\'s listed. I also used Mexican Blend shredded cheese. Overall it was very good and was a nice dinner on a cold and wet night. ', "" mmmmmmm!!!! This was SO good! It highly exceeded my expectations. I was mainly only cooking it because DH has been bugging me about cooking more mexican, but it was surprisingly good for being so simple. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made the following changes: added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, sauteed onions while the ground beef was browning, used 1/2 can of mexican Rotel (DH isn't a fan of tomatoes, hence the 1/2 instead of whole can), put cheese on all the layers (didn't need 4 full cups), sprinkled chili powder instead of using 2 full tbsp, and put a very thin layer of meat mixture on bottom of dish. I used flour tortillas because that was all I had and chili beans because I couldn't find ranch at the store, but I'd like to try it with the corn tortillas next time. And it's just as delicious the next day! DH even ate it as leftovers and that is a rarity. Thanks so much! It's definitely becoming a regular. :) "", "" This was excelent. I did make some changes though, I didn't have any tortillas so I used Baked Doritos. I also didn't have the ranch style beans so I used some left over beans I had made with the 15 bean soup and chicken thighs. Only used 2 cups cheese (all I had0. Then I added some frozen corn, onions, and salsa. "", ' This is very good and easy to make. I decided to layer the cheese throughout the casserole because 4 cups of cheese just sitting on top of the casserole seems like a lot. ', ' I had to make a last minute change to this. I ran out of chili powder, so inplace of it I put a package of Lipton Taco Rice in the meat toward the end of browning. I also used a can of refried beans instead of ranch. Then I topped it off with shredded lettuce and sour cream. My wife is Mexican....she LOVED it! ', "" I used flour tortillas and took previous reviewers suggestions and spread a little mixture on the bottom of the pan. I made two smaller pans instead of one big one and froze pan 2. Haven't cooked it yet to see if it freezes well but figured it was worth a shot. The fresh one was absolutely fabulous, and actually very healthy. Used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, it was all I had, some 2% shredded mexican blend cheese (didn't use nearly as much as called for, just a personal preference), and 1/2 ex lean ground turkey and 1/2 ex lean ground beef. I also added taco seasoning to the meat when browning. Never would have thought of using soup in a mexican casserole, but this is outstanding and totally easy to whip up. Great recipe!

I did tweak a couple of things but nothing that would have made enough of a difference to believe it could have been as bad as some users experienced. I doubled the cinnamon and added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. The apples I used were large so maybe those who thought there were not enough apples should go ahead and add more. Also the recipe does not specify light or dark brown sugar so I used dark as I thought that would go best in a Fall dessert. Beyond that I think it's important to follow the mixing directions exactly. It's always important to make sure the flour baking soda and spices are distributed well so sift them together or use a wire whisk to incorporate them. Mix the white sugar with the sliced apples (I actually diced the apples to make certain there would be apple in every bite.) Finally when adding the flour mixture mix it in only until it's fully incorporated. Do not overmix as this can lead to a tough cake. In my oven this cake took about an hour to bake not the 45 minutes specified. I'm about to make the cake again tomorrow it was that good!

Get your green toms from your garden or a farmer and view the cut open flesh.""Big Boy"" and ""Beefsteak"" are two types that fry well when green.

Slices from larger okra can be a bit tough, and though they still taste fine fried, I didn\'t enjoy them quite as much.

They turned out super fluffy and since I didn't use any pie crust they were also low carb! "", "" This was good but the taste of the green chiles isn't very apparent. I think the bacon overpowers it. I sauteed my onions before adding to the egg mixture because I don't care for the sharp flavor they have otherwise. There was enough filling to fill two frozen store-bought (Marie Callendar brand) piecrusts. "", ' This was my first attempt at a genuine quiche, and it turned out great! After reading the reviews I was afraid there would be too much filling, but while the crust was full there was no mess in the oven. I did have a 9.5"" pie pan, however. I also cooked the onions with the bacon for the great flavor, but that\'s just personal preference. I can\'t wait to try this with ham and cheese - thanks so much for sharing! ', ' We tried this quiche for brunch the other morning. We had company and the guests had seconds as did I. This is a very good recipe and easy to make. We did use two cans of green chilies 4oz each. This was the only change. ', "" Do NOT follow the recipe's amounts unless you have a deep pie plate because the amount of mixture will spill over EVERYWHERE!!!

"", "" The milk curdled when I added it to the lemon juice/sugar mix...what did I do wrong? Help I really want to try it! RE-REVIEW I'm so glad I tried it again! I did as suggested above and used the whisk beaters on my handheld electric mixer to first whisk the lemon juice and sugar together then while whisking I slowly drizzled in the milk. I used 4 cups of skim and 1 cup of 2% since I have a 4 qt. ice cream maker and others said it was overly sweet with just 4 cups of milk. It turned out wonderfully not quite as creamy as a sherbet but I would think if you used whole milk or some half &amp; half it would be richer but I liked it as is. I just wish the recipe listed a specific amount of lemon juice so I can get consistent results as lemons can vary in their juiciness. I actually used four smaller lemons and zested them all. I bet it would be good with lime and orange even raspberries as well and you could make your own rainbow ice. "", "" Delicious with Meyer lemons. For the person who wanted to know how to prevent clotting whisk the sugar and lemon together until smooth. Then slowly drizzle in milk a little at a time while whisking quickly. Keep whisking and adding milk in a little at a time until it's all gone. I also second the person who cut the milk down to 3 cups since my ice cream machine is a 1.5 qt. I make lots of ice cream and this recipe's a keeper! (It's also lower fat than my other ones...but now I wonder how this would taste with half cream and half milk...) So I made this a second time wth smaller less ripe meyer lemons (6 total) 1.5 cups of sugar and 2.25 cups of milk - still delicious and impressive. "", ' This is a wonderfully refreshing dessert. Since my family likes tart lemony desserts I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and in addition to the two lemons I added 3/4 cup of bottled lemon juice. This is a definite keeper! ', ' I made this last night and my family loved it! Make sure you mince the lemon zest as teeny as you can. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the lemon juice by quite a bit as we like things very tart. I would suggest adding the lemon juice a tablespoon at a time until you have the tartness you like. (As the recipe is written I think the lemon ice would be extremely sweet.) Once processed make sure you let the lemon ice age in the freezer in a tupperware container until it is a nice scoopable texture. (My kids ate some straight out of the ice cream maker and loved it soft as well.) Very nice and refreshing for a warm Southern California evening. You should try this one. ', "" Great recipe! Following the advice of others I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 c., (actually 1 c. sugar and 1/2 c. of Splenda), and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 c. of Meyer lemon juice. For those who would like to know how much juice one lemon has, I measured 1/4 c. from a medium sized lemon. It's only a general guideline. I'm sure it could vary depending on ripeness, etc. My result was excellent. Just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess, and I love that I don't have to feel guilty eating it.

Because the cereal was already flavored honey, and because I ran out, I replaced the honey (other than a few tablespoons) with sugar-free syrup (it's so low-calorie!!!)

Oh, also as soon as I made my first batch and was trying to press it into the pan it only filled up so I decided on the spot I wanted another batch.

Simply pour into the pan quickly and try to coat as much as possible before it hardens. It doesn't matter if it coats the bottom of the pan unevenly because the flan mixture sitting in the pan for 8 hours while it is refrigerating, will smooth out the melted sugar and make a perfect topping once it is flipped. (Trust me, both times the sugar hardened too quickly but the end result was perfection.) "", ' This tastes really great - the whole family loved it! I made it exactly as written. Some other reviews had trouble with the caramel but I made mine - just sugar - in about 7 minutes. I did warm the pan in the oven while it was heating and everything turned out a dream. One note about the pans - you really need a proper deep cake pan (NOT springform as water will get in) - I used an 8"" pan with 3"" sides and it was perfect. I did have a 10"" pan but found it wouldn\'t fit into any of my baking pans for the ""bath"" - I also would find it challenging to find a 10"" rimmed platter (and it does need a rim as the caramel is runny) - so the 8"" was great to fit into a baking pan and onto a plate. ', "" Loved this recipe! I made three for a big party and it was great. Some tips I used were to let the eggs and cream cheese come to room temp before mixing, be sure to beat well after each egg is added for the lightest texture and don't overcook sugar in the first step. If you do make more than one at a time like I did, do not try to do the carmelized sugar in one large batch, it will not work well, I had brittle sugar by the time it had all melted, then I redid it in individual batches. But I used the brittle for decoration. "", "" This has a very nice texture. It is very dense and more like cheesecake which I like. I did have a few problems though. I can't melt sugar and make caramel. I used a recipe that calls for 2 cups of sugar and 3/4 cup of water and cooked that and made beautiful caramel. Just a reminder to others make sure all your ingerdients are at room temp. not just the cream cheese. ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22220

It was WONDERFUL...so good that this is the first review I'm writing! All three of my kids asked for more, and they won't eat anything! Here's what I did: trim fat, coat with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, garlic powder, onion flakes and cracked pepper. Then I refridgerated it in a bag for an hour, but I think it would have been fine without. Then I poured some Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs into the bag and shook it until coated. Baked at 425 for 45 mintues. It was mouthwatering. Served with mashed potatoes and peas and it was a huge hit with almost no work. Try it! "", "" My teenagers inhaled this one!! I coated the tenderloin with oil and made homemade bread crumbs as my girls can't eat most storebought crumbs as they have milk intolerances. I mixed in oregano, basil, rosemary, onion and garlic powder. This was the most moist pork I've ever had. Do place it on a sheet of tinfoil to keep from having to scrub the pan and tent it with tinfoil, because it burns within a few minutes if left uncovered. Uncover during the last few minutes to brown crust. It certainly helps to have it stand at the end. Overall, it was just terrific "", "" Original Review Dec 2003: This was an incredibly quick and easy recipe. The presentation is beautiful and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of sprinkling the tenderloins with a little garlic powder and black pepper prior to breading. It does seem to be a lot of breading, but the crumbs contain all the flavor, and using the amount called for ensures you have enough left for a nice breading after slicing. Line your pan with foil -- the meat won't stick and you won't have a pan to wash! :) Update - Feb 2009: I've made this so many times and just wanted to add that I try to remove from the oven when the internal temp is 145 because USDA guidelines for whole pieces of pork have changed since my original review. Because pork tenderloins are so lean, you don't want to overcook them as they can easily dry out. A bit of pink is good in this instance! Use a meat thermometer and remove when temp hits 145. Keep in mind that the internal temp will rise a few degrees during the standing process. So juicy, tender and delicious! One of our favorite recipes! "", ' Easy, yes and perhaps you could even get away with elegant depending on what you choose to serve as your sides. First, you do have to spruce up the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I always doctor them up with a bit of garlic, parsley, italian seasoning, crushed rosemary, and Parmesan cheese. I eyeball everything and mix it together. Now, instead of the oil I tried something a little bit different. I used an egg wash - two eggs with a little milk. I dipped the tenderloins in the egg and bread crumb mixture twice, essentially ""double dipping"" in order to get a nice thick bread crumb coating. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with Pam to prevent sticking, put the tendeloins in and took the rest of the egg and breadcrumb mixture combined them forming a stuffing mixture and layed that into the pan as well. I sprayed a little Pam over everything, baked the tenderloins at 400 for 20 minutes, turned them and baked for another 25 minutes. They were moist, tender, and juicy - perfect. There\'s nothing worse than dried out pork! ', ' Excellent dinner tonight! I did alter it some picking ideas from others here. I marinated it for 2 hours in a baggie of olive oil, mustard, crushed garlic, salt &amp; pepper &amp; some sliced green onions. Then I put the breadcrumbs in a large baggie, placed the tenderloin in &amp; shook it up til it was coated. I baked at 425 covered w/ tented foil. Baked 1/2 hr &amp; then removed foil. Baked til it registered 145 degrees. Let it rest for 10 mins &amp; it was very tender &amp; flavorful. My very picky chef father in law was impressed! I served w/ roast potatoes, salad &amp; leftover green bean casserole we had yesterday (Easter). Thanks for the inspiration! ', "" This couldn't have been any more tender! Instead of mixing the olive oil with the bread crumbs, I rubbed the tenderloin with the oil, then rolled in the breadcrumbs. Such an easy dish to serve for company. "", ' This had so much flavor and was so tender and juicy. I seasoned it with onion and garlic salt. Then put it in a medium size bowl rolled it in olive oil then added italian seasoning and bread crumbs in a gallon size ziplock bag, put the pork in the bag and pressed the bread crumb mixture on.

I have found it here in the Gulf Coast of Texas and saw it on vacation once in Destin Florida (slapyamama.com). I like it because it\'s not as salty as some other popular brands of cajun seasoning.

I have made this recipe many many times! I am just finally getting around to reviewing it. My husband asks for this often. The fresh taste of tomatoes accented by the Cajun seasoning. Yum Yum. I always use Penne pasta. It just seems to go nicely with the sauce. (I actually don t care too much for vermicelli pasta; I like to really taste and feel the texture of my noodles -and vermicelli lacks that for me.)

My family loved this pasta dish--we fought over the leftovers. ', ' I added some fresh basil to this recipe along with chicken and shrimp and it was quite good. I think more tomatoes than recommended would be better next time. ', ' This is a very easy to make recipe that is great when you are short on time. The cajun spice mix you use is everything to the recipe so choose wisely. ', ' I had to restrain myself from eating too much of this tonight. Yeah it was that good. I sauteed some sweet mini peppers before adding the garlic and tomatoes just for a little more interest and complexity. The Cajun seasoning I used was Coleen Deon\'s ""Cajun Spice Mix "" also from this site and I was very pleased with it. In addition to the olive oil I added butter as well which made this silky and rich. Loved the addition of the two cheeses but don\'t be tempted to add too much mozzarella or you\'ll risk making this stringy. ', ' Very good! I reduced the salt to 2 tsp used 2 tsp of dried parsley and subbed monteray jack for the mozzarella cos that is what I had. Turns out really well especially since I cooked it in my large electric skillet there was plenty of room to toss everything together. This recipe doesn\'t suffer from the ""not quite enough tomatoes"" problem that some do. ', "" Mmm this is amazing! I one-and-a-halfed this (not quite doubled it if that makes any sense) so I chopped 3 tomatoes to go along with one 28oz can of diced tomatoes. I added more minced garlic than the revised proportions called for and replaced the salt with freshly ground pepper. My only qualm was too much mozzarella cheese due to personal preference so next time I'll decrease. But wow- amazing dish a keeper!

I suppose you could use gorgonzola in place of bleu cheese if you prefer a milder flavor (gorgonzola is milder than bleu).... This tastes just like Stouffer's fettuccini alfredo! I think next time I'll experiment by using green fettuccini!Serve with an Olive Garden salad (I made my own version) and garlic breadsticks (be sure to dip them in the sauce - yum!). This one's a keeper! "", "" I thought this was a fantastic recipe. Its the first fettucini I've ever made and it turned out great. I did make a few changes as I went along though including sizing it down to 2 servings. I left the garlic in since I love garlic and instead of Italian seasoning I used about a half dozen fresh basil leaves chopped. I used half and half instead of cream and it worked fine might even have been better. And last! After I tossed the sauce and pasta together I cut up a ripe tomato and a couple green onions and stirred them in. Really a wonderful dish and one I'd serve to company. "", ' This sauce was very good the only thing I changed was I put gorgonzola cheese instead of blue cheese next time I almost might put a little less italian seasoning and more parmesan we served it over pasta mixed with spinach and mushrooms and topped with steak fillets it was excellent!

I'm going to cut back on the Italian seasonings next time. It was just a tad too much for our taste.

I tried this out because I was curious about the creamed corn base - all of my curries use tomatoes.

In the past 2 or 3 years, most major grocers carry curry paste - it's different from curry sauce. Also, other reviewers have mentioned this, the brand makes a HUGE difference. I only use Patak's. I'm always trying different brands because I like to think of myself as a lover of shortcuts - curry paste is one of them. I've used Patak's faithfully ever since I left my parents and missed authentic South Indian cooking (spicy flavorful &amp; spicy hot). I used a medium hot paste because I'm not sure how much my 18 month can do - it must have been just right because she inhaled it as did my 5 year old. As far as measurements go - I don't use them. The beauty of curry is it's YOUR special blend. I'm writing home about this one! "", "" I have never made an indian dish that tasted so authentic!

Once tender, shredded and then chopped coarsely. I didn't bother w/separate grn chili/sour crm/cheese sauce as I don't care for s.cream in the filling. Instead, I put the prepared beef in a bowl adding the grn chilies along with some of the cooking juice. At this point I store in fridge until next day. When I was ready to assemble I veered off from this recipe and finished up in my own style. I really like the shredded beef even if I added a couple ingredients. By cooking the meat a day ahead, I find making any style enchiladas that much easier. "", "" I'm actually cooking this now! and have a question- what are people usin for the red sauce that goes on top? Or is this recipe better with out? A few people mentioned it and I didn't know if I should give it a try? Thanks for any feedback! "", ' The best Enchiladas recipe I have ever tried! Wonderful! To reduce effort, cook the pot roast in a crock pot for 4 hours on high with the beef broth, red wine vinegar, chili powder, and ground cumin as instructed (or cook about 2 to 2 1/2 hours on the stove top on low in a heavy covered pot until the roast is ready to fall apart). Skim fat from leftover broth because we want to take care of our hearts. Prepare as instructed in the original recipe. ', ' I agree with a number of other reviewers that while the meat itself is really quite good - tender, juicy and flavorful, the enchiladas themselves were disappointing. I had higher hopes for this than was delivered. First of all, after reading through the recipe I knew this would be dry without some kind of sauce, so I poured green enchilada sauce over them before topping with the cheese and baking. It helped somewhat, but this was still a mediocre dish, tasting more of the corn tortillas than anything else. (I\'ve now determined that flour tortillas are definitely better than corn tortillas!) One reviewer said it best when she said these were ""edible and forgettable,"" and another who remarked that the meat was great...just not in these enchiladas. ', "" I really liked these enchiladas. I didn't find them to be that time consuming but I started with having some shredded beef and looking for a way to cook it so I didn't spend time on that. Next time I'll start from the beginning because my meat was not prepared according to the recipe and it sounds really good! I changed a fewv things. I used non-fat flour tortillas as that's all I had. I didn't use oil but I made some enchilada sauce from this site called 10 minute enchilada sauce. Instead of the oil I poured some sauce in the pan and covered both sides of the tortilla with the sauce. Then I followed the recipe with the cheese sauce and the meat. I only had low fat sour cream and it was fine. Also I didn't have any onions so they were left out. Anyway I poured the left over sauce on top and covered it with cheese. I'm not sure how much and it wasn't the kind called for in the recipe. It was a combination of grated mexican cheese mozarella and some irish cheese. (Can you tell I was cleaning out the fridge?) Anyway it was absoultely great!!!!! Next time I'll shop for the recipe and do it right. Edited to add: I made this again. I put all the ingredients for the beef in a crockpot for 8 hours on low. The flavor of the meat is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I found myself eating the meat as I rolled the enchiladas and there is none left over! YUM! One more thing I ran out of cheese sauce before I ran out of meat so I would double the cheese sauce. "", "" Oh my....this was absoultely DELICIOUS!!! I can't tell you Christy how much we enjoyed this meat. I used about 2-1/2 lbs of beef stew meat. I left out the water and mixed the beef broth, vinegar and spices in my crockpot and then added the beef. I let that cook on HIGH for about 8 hours. I chopped up 1 large white onion, 4 garlic cloves and a red bell pepper and sauteed it in a large pot until soft and then transfered the meat from the crockpot. I added a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies and turned the heat on med-hi and let most of the liquid boil off and ended up with the most tender and flavorful shredded beef I've ever made. I did have to add quite a bit of salt to achieve the right taste (we love salt). I skipped the sour cream and rather than making enchiladas, I let everyone assemble burritos with flour tortillas. I made my own pico de gallo to go along with this and grated some fresh pepper-jack cheese. I will definitley use this again and plan on passing this recipe along to others. Thanks a million!!! "", ' I made this for a party and everyone asked for the recipe. Delicious. I made it exactly as written except that I poured Red Enchilada Sauce (recipe on this site) over the top before sprinkling the cheese and baked. A bit time consuming but worth the effort.

That only makes sense!) I didn\'t have any of the problems that the other cooks experienced and I did not find the beans to be very ""labor intensive"".

Otherwise they are a perfect side dish for a weekday or weekend meal. ', ' I modified this a bit just to suit my tastes and to use the frozen French-style green beans I had on hand. I cooked the beans till nearly done and while they were cooking sauteed the onion in butter rather than margarine with some fresh minced garlic.

Heather\'s picture adequately demonstrates this recipe, the other picture is showing fried green plantains, they are different. Amarillos turn out sweet, not crunchy and darker in color when compared to green. I like to use plantains with yellow and black skins or all black. You can eat them by themselves or sometimes I like to sprinkle grated parmesan on top. ', "" My husband makes these, we all love them. You didn't mention that if they are green they need to be fried twice, flatten in the middle of cooking. Good with garlic &amp; salt. We also slice them in circles. When very over ripe the sugars come out and caramelize. Great for breakfast. "", "" Wow, there is so much confusion around plantains. I was looking up recipes to post pictures and a lot of people have them mixed up. I grew up with them, so lets see if I can help a bit. Ok, there is only 1 kind of plantain but there are 3 colors, depending on its age. Order is green, yellow, then black. Green is for TOSTONES, or light gold pieces that are cut into rounds, fried, mashed and fried again. They're salty. Personally I like to throw on some minced garlic on top out of a jar with some juice and a sprinkle of salt. Some people go for garlic powder instead. Then you have PLATANOS MADUROS, or ripe plantains that are used to make this sugary version. The color to make these is when your plantain is BLACK. The riper the plantain, the sweeter it is and that's the trick. It should be slightly mushy to the touch. The best way to tell if its good to fry is if, once peeled, its still got a tan color, not brown or black. In my family, we cut these at an angle. These are perfectly sweet as is, so I don't add anything extra. The last is yellow. These are usually not hard enough for tostones, and definitely not soft enough for platanos maduros so some people chop them up and boil them to eat either in or along with soups. They don't taste that good boiled so its not so popular. If it were me, I'd wait til it goes black and make these yummy sugary ones. Hope this helps! "", ' A dear friend from Tennessee introduced my family to fried plantains years ago. We slice them into thin rounds and using a cast-iron skillet fry them up with just a few Tablespoons each of oil and butter. Seasoned with salt garlic and a squeeze of fresh lime juice they make for a great side to a variety of Caribbean and Latin-themed meals. For an addictive snack try adding a sprinkling of chili power or cayenne along with the other spices.

Why not serve yours like the Peruvians do, with a juicy steak and a generous portion of rice topped with two sunny-side-up eggs. The meal, called ""Bistec a lo Pobre"", offers a delicious combination of sweet and salty flavors. ', ' I find that plantains that have turned mostly black are perfect for frying. Yum! ', ' Great!

And if you don't push them back down immediately after they come out of the oven they get hardened like that very quickly. I followed the instructions of keeping the filling warm to fill the chocolate molds and if you don't it begins to separate and the coconut falls to the bottom. At this point in the recipe it should tell you to chill the cups before adding the chocolate topping. I added the chocolate on top of the warm filling and it just ran all over the pan making a huge mess. After doing 3 cups I stopped put the pan in the fridge and chilled for about 30 minutes. Then I came back to a slightly thickened chocolate glaze and added it onto the chilled coconut filling. This worked much better. In the end the chocolate cups were kind of hard and crumbly and the filling is extremely sweet. But after my changes they did turn out very pretty with some sliced almonds on top. Too many steps too much work and not a great finished product. "", "" I've made these twice and the second time I think I got it right. Why add a second egg? Just cut the flour down to 1/4 cup and it's the perfect consistency. I used paper liners but just rolled the balls and dropped them into the liners. Also Ladies to address the comments about only getting X amount of treats remember we're talking inches in female mentality. An inch is an inch and I got 52-60 treats. I baked them for 9 minutes but oven temps vary. Dido on pressing a thumbprint after they come out of the oven. I did let them cool for a few minutes before carefully taking them out of the muffin tin to let them firm up a bit. That way it frees up the tins for a second batch since I only have two tins.

Here's what I did: I sprinkled the pork chops with seasoning salt garlic powder and Italian seasoning before browning them with some chopped onion. To the soup I added garlic powder Italian seasoning and chives. Now here is where I probably made the mistake: Per previous comments I wanted to make sure there was enough sauce so I added a small can of evaporated milk. DO NOT ADD EVAPORATED MILK!! My potatoes ended up sticking to the bottom of the pan so bad that I was scraping overcooked/almost-burnt potato chunks out. The potatoes ended up tasting GREAT (even the overcooked scraped-out bits!) but the chops didn't come out so well. My daughter ate some of the chops but both my husband and I were really not thrilled with the chops. They were really dry. Again probably my fault. Next time I'll either use the original recipe (plus seasonings) in the slow cooker or I'll just cook the potatoes in the soup and prepare the chops separately. Thanks for an interesting base recipe! UPDATED 12/14/05 - Made it again without the milk same stuck-to-the-pan end. Must be my pan. It's easy and convenient the taste is fine (once you spice up a regular can of soup)...

', ' I just made these this morning and they are wonderful! I did make a few adjustments however. I substituted whole wheat flour for AP omitted the nuts used mini chocolate chips. I also substituted 2 tbsp of pumpkin puree for the oil this not only cuts the fat almost completely out but helps the batter to have more body. It made 17 good sized muffins. ', "" The muffins were great! Very easy to make and lovely to eat considering this is only my third attempt at baking! Everyone loved them! I also took the advice of SukeyNY and used the following: 1.5 cups of milk 3 tbsp of oil 3/4 cup of cocoa and 1/2 tsp salt. Also we made a mistake when purchasing the ingredients and got chopped almonds instead of whole ones so we used a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts 1/3 cup of chopped almonds in addition to the chocolate chips. The muffins tasted wonderful anyway and richer besides. We also forgot to sprinkle the sugar before baking but reading the other reviews I guess that's just as well. With all the extras this recipe can yield at LEAST 16 muffins. We made 12 anyway by filling the muffin cups to the top so they were HUGE and lopsided but very moist. I hope this helped! "", "" Good overall flavor. First this made 20 regular sized muffins. Also many reviewers stated that their chocolate chips sank to bottom of muffin; to resolve this issue dust chocolat chips with 1T flour. For those who think this is a dry muffin check your cocoa. If it's dark or dutch cocoa you should add extra dairy fat (think sour cream) since chocolate especially dark and dutch will absorb the fat content in a recipe and dry it out (also the milk should not be skim or low fat). Also if you omit the nuts this too will dry out the recipe as nuts add / help maintain moisture. That being said I used 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1 T oil plus 1T applesauce. Since I use a cocoa which is half semi-sweet / half dutch I added 2 t sour cream (double that if your cocoa is not a combo). My milk was 2% but whole milk would've been a better option. Also do not overcook. I baked 20 minutes and removed IMMEDIATELY from pan to help end residual baking. My muffins were chocolately and moist. The family really enjoyed. Better than store bought. P.S. For high altitude I reduced the baking powder by 1/2 t; this helps with over rising which leads to a deflated end product. "", "" Whoa. Careful with these don't eat 'em for breakfast or you'll experience something akin to Death By Chocolate. These are for 'after' a meal or an afternoon snack. I put a green M&amp;M on top of each because as everyone knows they are a very strong aphrodisiac. I give these muffins five stars. "", "" This is our favorite chocolate chocolate chip muffin recipe!

The recipe calls for 2 tsp of vanilla and I used one tablespoon. I cut the sugar in half and it was still very sweet. If I had used the full amount it would have been inedible. As far as the apples go I waited until the batter was completely mixed before preparing the apples. Otherwise they get brown. I diced 4 and shredded three. The shredded apples just disappear into the cake and I wanted some texture so the diced bits worked out well. It also avoided that issue of the cake being too soggy. If you choose to shred all of them drain some but not all of the juice out. Some juice is needed to moisten the batter. The smell when baking filled the house with wonderful autumn like aromas. The cake came out wonderful. I dusted it with a little confectioner\'s sugar and served it with vanilla ice cream on the side. In my opinion it didn\'t need any icing or frosting.

I will admit it was a little dry for my taste a little extra sauce never hurts either! Italian bread crumbs are fine if you don't have regular but I think Italian adds a little more flavor. What really made it yummy was the cheese I added. Seperate the meatloaf into 2 parts. Shape the bigger half into a loaf and add slices of cheese on top of it. Any cheese any amount is fine. I used 3 slices of provolone and it was great! Next time I'll use a few more slices. After the cheese is added shape the remaining meat mixture over top and cook!

Delicious and guilt-free! I used seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, with salt and pepper added for flavor. Even my picky kids loved it.

But a friend gave me an eggplant, so I wanted to use it and decided to give this recipe a shot. It was fantastic. I learned that I much prefer thin slices. The eggplant browns quickly, so be prepared to watch it like a hawk. Brown is good; black is not. I didn't burn any, but it was close.

A lot like the pot stickers my mom and I make together. You can put pretty much anything into these (tofu, bean sprouts, onion, different kinds of meat, etc) but it is very important that you squeeze as much liquid out of the filling (if you use tofu or a lot of vegetables) as you can before you stuff your wrappers or they will tear as you cook them. And as you seal the wrappers try to squeeze out as much air as you can or they can tear as they cook. The amount of water to steam them is completely dependant on the thickness of your wrappers. I got some from Walmart that were delicious, but a little thin so they didn't need too much water (3/4 c?) My mom's from the asian market were much thicker and needed a lot of water (about a cup, maybe more). Cooking the pork beforehand is completely unnecessary. You can also cook them by just frying them on both sides or boiling them in soup. They freeze very well, but will need an extra minute or two for cooking time.

But BE CAREFUL the instructions say to cook the pot stickers in oil and then add water. I knew water and oil didn't mix so I tried to add the water carefully to the side of the pan and hot grease went flying everywhere. I even got burnt on my cheek. I then came up with a two skillet solution (frying the pot stickers in one pan and then moving them to a 2nd pan for steaming). Also I highly recommend keeping a couple eggs mixed with a bit of water in a bowl near your prep area because you will have to use it to get the wrappers to stick. I coated each of the four sides of the wrapper as it was laying out flat before putting the mixture in. Then after the wrapper was closed I wet my fingers again with egg wash and coated the outside seam. I would have given this recipe 4 stars for the end result because I think they turned out well but the danger of mixing oil with water really needs to be addressed in the main writing of this recipe.

As always well worth the time and effort. ', "" I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I used one pound uncooked ground pork (they're much easier to make this way, and this is how they do it in China) and about 1/2 cup finely shredded cabbage, and no waterchestnuts, to make about 45 pot stickers (or dumplings) using the round wrappers for dumplings available at Asian markets is best--they're thinner. I covered a deep frying pan with PAM--and sprayed some on the dumplings themselves--then browned bottoms for about 4 min. Then I slowly added 1/2 water to pan, covered, and steamed for 10 min. Then I uncovered the pan and let them cook until all the water was gone. (Made this in three batches.)If you're afraid the pork is not completely cooked, you may steam/cook longer, but usually that's plenty of time. Another excellent sauce is to simply combine balsamic vinegar and a small amount of chili oil (avail. at Asian market)in a bowl for dunking. "", "" Wow what a great recipe. I've made these twice, the second time I cooked them a little differently.Heated 2 tblsp. of oil over medium heat. Lightly browned them until golden on the bottom then poured 1 cup of water into the skillet and covered immediately. Cooked them over medium heat until most of the liquid was gone. Uncovered and continued cooking until the liquid was entirely gone and they were golden on the bottom. I served them with Szechwan sauce I purchased at Safeway. My husband went crazy over them!!! The also freeze very well. "", "" This recipe was excellent!!!! Similar to the ones you would get from a Chinese restaurant or even Friday's. I made modifications to the recipe not because I felt they needed it but because I was trying to make these a little more healthy. I did omit the cabbage (I haven't seen ones with cabbage in them) and I used ground chicken instead of pork. I used ground ginger. I also added minced carrots and onions. I left the ground chicken raw and mixed the ingredients then cooked them in peanut oil instead of sesame oil and then steamed them in chicken broth. While steaming I placed a top on top of the skillet. I also steamed for additional 7 minutes - wanted to make sure the ground chicken was thoroughly cooked. I also used Leanne's sauce of 2 TBSP soy sauce 2 TBSP rice wine vinegar 1 tsp sesame oil and 1 tsp minced scallion which was right on point. Loved this recipe and will definitely make again!!!! "", "" This recipe is incredible. However, I'm going to address the review that states that this cooking method is unsafe. These are traditionally cooked this way. I cook them in a pan with oil and, when they are lightly browned, you add water which will remain on top of the oil (because they don't mix) and you continue to cook them until the water boils off. Continue to cook them until they are slightly crispy. There is no danger in cooking them this way, so please don't be afraid based on the directions in this recipe. "", "" tastes exactly like my Grandma Kwong's! For people whom don't realize how to cook them, it is true that you first put them in a touch of oil to brown the bottoms (meaning the fan is at the top and a flat side must be formed for the bottom), and then add a little bit of water for steaming. For those that state that this isn't right, believe me it is...I am Chinese and was raised in a chinese home. This is the traditional way on how to cook them. As well, to keep the dough together and be able to do the fan folding seam, DO NOT USE EGG! Use water, egg gives them a unappealing taste! "", ' These were wonderful--a lot of work though but worth it. I combined two recipes together. I only used 1/2 c. chopped cabbage using the blender method to chop. It was easy this way just make sure you squeeze the water out before adding it to the mixture. I also didn\'t precook my pork just mixed and let it sit while I made the dough. If you want to make your own dough use 2 c. flour and 3/4 c. 2 Tbsp. water--allow to rest for 30 min. Then roll out to 1/8"" thick and cut with 3"" circle cutter. Make sure these are really cooked before serving since the pork wasn\'t precooked. Mine took about 15 min. total. First I browned them in a little oil for 5 min. then poured 1/3 c. water and covered tightly simmering 10 min. or until liquid is gone. Enjoy! ']",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22460

I made both bread and muffins(doubled the recipe) and they were sooo moist!!! After reading other reviews I read the proportions of ingredients and was quite perplexed as to how this was going to turn out. There did seem to be a bigger proportion of dry ingredients to the liquid. The adjustments I made were: I added the sugar and salt to the apples first to leech out the juice. I also added just a splash of orange juice (maybe two tbsp) and grated some orange rind. I immediately wrapped the bread when it cooled and put in fridge and put the muffins in a plastic container with lid. I couldn't resist the muffins so tried them about an hour later; the bread in the fridge until the next day. Both were so moist and there was no crumbling at all. I think alot depends on the type of apple. When I started slicing into what I had(red delicious) they were quite juicy so I am sure that helped. I also added a bit more cinnamon and a half tsp of nutmeg to the DOUBLE batch I made; would use a quarter tsp. to the single recipe. I also added a tsp of vanilla.

I couldn't wait overnight to bake this bread. Baking at the time of mixing, it turned out perfectly. Very flavorful and attractive presentation. I'm not sure what the reviewers are doing wrong who believe it needs more liquid. This recipe makes a very stiff batter rather than a soupy one, but coming out of the oven, it is perfect! Next time I'm going to try a little extra cinnamon and about 3/4t salt. But that's just my experimental nature! :-) "", ' I have to agree with the reviewer who only got crumbs. There is not enough liquid in this recipe to make a batter. I had to add more and even then there was way more fruit and nuts than ""batter."" Perhaps the secret lies in letting the apples sit in the sugar for a long time thus drawing out their juices? Maybe that\'s the secret and why it works to freeze this recipe before baking. That would give enough time for the apple juices to saturate the flour mixture. Definitely a wierd recipe. The bread itself tastes fine but doesn\'t hold together all that well.

As for the kitchen novice no excuses! I am a 21 year old college student who is just learning how to cook! As for complaints about the spinach mixture you must like spinach enoungh to withstand the bitter taste. I love spinach but still used more than enough pepper to hide the taste.

Jalapenos can cause some really severe skin irritation. ', ' This recipe tasted OK but was incredibly messy to make. It is hard to wrap slimy bacon around a slippery pepper and make sure it stays in place. When cooking them the main problem was keeping them in the broiler long enough to get the bacon to crisp up without all of the cheese melting and running out. For the second batch we precooked the bacon about halfway but this only helped slightly. Overall I would not recommend this recipe. It was just not worth the mess for the mediocre results.

NEVER melt directly on the stove! use a double broiler or in 30 second increments in a microwave stirring in between segments (don\'t use glass bowls plastic only) 3.

Using the canned milk makes crystalization less likely but caramels are still prone... so get out your wet pastry brush or wet paper towels and WIPE ALL THE TIME to stop the crystals. ', "" These are great!! And make wonderful gifts. Wrap in freezer paper &amp; put in a nice jar, candy dish, or tin. Also be sure you get to the right temp or you will get candies that are hard if to hot, or really chewy if to cool. And for those getting a grainy chocolate you can take out the butter altogether or use a 1/2 of food grade coco-butter (or 30% of your chocolate ratio) this makes for a wonderful chocolate experience too. Also keep your chocolate over a double boiler on the lowest heat possible, this will keep it at a dipping level. Instead of the dipping method I like to pour a layer of chocolate in a wax papered lined Pan (or over my marble block) let it set completely then pour my carmel over this, let it set up. Cut into squares &amp; slightly separate the squares, or put them on to a cooling rack with a cookie sheet under them, then slowly pour your remaining chocolate over each. You can then reheat the chocolate that drips off and repeat process. This will get a uniform &amp; perfect coating over each candy. They look like you bought them from a fancy chocolate shop, ;c) it sounds hard but it is much easier to get a good coat with out all the mess, dipping, &amp; fork marks. I have had a lot of holes and marks in my candies, lol.. I love that I figured this out. Thank u to the one who posted this recipe, it's great!! "", ' Happily these aren\'t as super-sweet as my husband expected them to be. I poured the recipe into a 9 x 13"" pan and cut them into 3/4"" squares. This gave me about 150 caramels.

I had a hard time getting them out of the pan after refrigerating so I just worked with them at room temperature. These would make an excellent Christmas gift for the caramel-lover on your list. Thanks Cheryl!

I made it without the chocolate and added 1/2 tsp of salt to bring out the flavor. Note that this caramel will stick to wax paper. Wrap these in plastic wrap if you want individually wrapped pieces. ', "" We made these chocolate covered caramels last year and they are simply to die for. I'm a big fan of chewy caramel with rich flavors and dark smooth chocolate. Together this created a real treat. My tip for getting them to stay their shape and look pretty is cut them into squares and then refrigerate them so they're cool when you put the warm chocolate on them. The best way I've found to put chocolate on them is to use a pastry brush and just pick up the caramel and paint the bottom then the top. It works wonderful and they look great. I then put them on wax paper and put in the fridge right away. I found some great chocolate boxes and accessories at Michael's craftstore and I'm going to gift these for Valentine's this year. The caramel taste of this treat is very addicting...Enjoy. "", "" I had never attempted making caramels before this so I was worried but surprisingly this recipe could not have turned out any better! The caramels are rich and creamy and so flavorful. Next time I make them though I will keep half of the batch without chocolate because after a few days the chocolate gets a little bit crusty/grainy. But if you eat them while they are fresh they're fabulous. The caramels without chocolate however keep fresh for a long time. VERY good recipe...thank you!! "", ' Help! I have tried the recipe twice but my caramels came out way to hard. The 2nd time I used the lower end of the temperature range. The flavor is wonderful though, but they are way too hard.

Thanks Nette and Leslie;) "", "" This was excellent and got rave reviews. I used the suggestions made by Leslie A. (marscapone and sugar) and made a few other adjustments. 1- I increased the amount of marscapone to 16oz. total. I think it needs a thicker layer of both creams but I did not adjust the amt of liquid I mixed it with and it came out nice and firm and held a nice shape on the plate. I was surprised how loose the Coffee/Liquor/Cheese mix was but it chilled nicely. 2-I used Kahlua instead of Amaretto Also since Ladyfingers come in different textures (the traditional crispy biscuit or a spongecake version) I was unsure how it would turn out as this recipe didn't specify. I selected the Crispy Ladyfingers and let them soak in the coffee/liquor for about 5 mins. Turned out just right! A new family favorite! ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22587

Temperature is critical anytime you work with sugar. The final consistency is almost 100% dependant on the temperature. At 245 you get caramel, at 310 you get toffee. I would not recommend making this without a candy thermometer. Use the thickest pot you can, to prevent scorching. Stir ocassionally until 300 and then not at all until 310. This reduces the time it takes to climb the last 10 degrees and reduces the chance of burning. Remove from heat at precisely 310-do it fast and pour it fast, trust me on that.

I hope this helps anyone who wants to make this wonderfully addictive candy "", "" December 19, 2012: Over the years of making this candy, I have simplified everything. No longer do I put chocolate on the bottom. I now use 3 cups of toasted nuts &amp; this year I used a combo of cashews, almonds &amp; pecans. In past years, I've used white chocolate &amp; cashews, which has become a family favorite. This year, I used Lindt 90% Dark Chocolate Bars. After I poured the hot nut filled toffee out on a parchement paper lined cookie sheet, I laid the bars down on top &amp; they melted like butter. Next I melted Lindt White Coconut Chocolate &amp; flung it over the dark, melted chocolate. I used a tooth pick to score back &amp; forth across the chocolate, which made a beautiful pattern. The less sweet dark chocolate pared well with the toffee, which is plenty sweet enough &amp; this creation is yet another favorite of mine. The possibilities are endless! Enjoy &amp; have fun being creative! "", ' The first time I made this, I cooked the candy to 310 degrees. In a second it went from smelling great to smelling burnt and separating. The second time and third time I made it, I buttered the sides of the pan and did not stir it at all until it reached 300 degrees, rather than 310 degrees. It was perfect and delicious both times. ', "" Update to my previous review: Use the nonstick foil in the bottom of the pan you are using for the chocolate. I find after spreading the warm chocolate put in the fridge to cool and harden while cooking the toffee. I have much better results with the non stick foil vs the wax paper which tends to leave residue. And an A to the pizza cutter idea! Awesome recipe. My 2nd year for xmas gifting and my friends can't get enough of it. I find that using a candy thermometer that attaches to the side of the pan is helpful in candy making. Also I've cut recipe in 1/2 by using 1 1/3 packed cups of Brown sugar and halving everything else. I've also found putting it into the fridge for 3 hours is really helpful. Plus use very good chocolate to make it special! "", "" My first attempt at this recipe flopped -I had grainy toffee which had the consistency of fudge - tasted good but it just wasn't toffee. I tried again and Voila! I was able to make wonderful toffee. Here are my tips: most importantly TEST your candy thermometer! If you get 212 degrees in boiling water then you know it's accurate (mine was 10 degrees off!) Also the tip shouldn't be touching the bottom of the pan but somewhere in the middle of the syrup. I used a Silpat silicone baking mat instead of greasing the pan and it worked wonderfully. No sticking at all. I didn't stir as much the 2nd time since someone said that allows the candy to heat up very quickly at the end and scorch. I also used a wire whisk instead of a wooden spoon that I used the first time. Lastly I made one batch without the bottom chocolate layer and almonds only on top of the top chocolate layer and broke the toffee up like brittle a little less expensive and still tastes good! Another batch I scored with a knife and broke up into squares when it cooled - also worked great. I used Ghiradelli chips and they melted beautifully but when I used Hershey chips they did not so I'd recommend using a good quality chocolate if you can. I'm proudly going to take my re-worked batches to a cookie exchange today and can't wait to hear what everyone thinks! Oh and another reviewer explained how to make a half batch and it worked perfectly too! (use 1 1/3 c packed brown sugar and halve the other ingr "", ' Thank you so much Janis! I carefully read your tips and everything went smoothly. I thought ""that\'s it?!?"" at the end of it all. Was it ever easy and quick!

My only question is how do you score the Almond Roca so that the pieces are uniform and appear attractive when presenting them as gifts? ', "" Hi Mountain Ash...I'm the one who submitted this recipe. Yes you can score the candy while it's still hot so that you can break it apart into even pieces. Use parchement paper so you can pull it out of the pan after it's completely cooled. You have to work fast and cut through it while it's still good and hot...but it can be done. I've done this myself but I've gotten lazy and just prefer to break it apart. I saw a chopping utensil a few days ago that would work well for scoring the candy. It cuts in a rocking motion side to side. I found it at Harris-Gottschalks. Hope this helps you out. Good luck.

Everyone begs for it and wants the recipe. Nobody can believe how simple it is with just 4 ingredients. I make 2 batches at Christmas and can't keep it around. For those of you who have had trouble you must use a candy thermometer and make sure it is a good one. Take it off the range immediately at 310 or it will taste burnt. I put all the almonds in the toffee mixture (none on top - just my personal preferance) right when I take it off the heat stir quickly and pour over the milk chocolate. Never failed!

So after frying for 15 mintues first, I then threw it in the oven for 20 instead. The chicken came out very juicy, but bland. The cheese could hardly be tasted and the watery taste of the chicken dispersed the rasberry flavor. I will try this again with just frying like it calls, but I will use more oil than is being called for, fry in a small pan and maybe cover it or something. Also, someone mentioned that they had issues having the pecans stick to the chicken. This was my other reason for putting it in the oven where there would not be a necessity to turn it over many times, hence making the pecans fall off. However, I think there is a fix for this. This would involve crushing the nuts to almost a powder before covering the chicken. (If you like the crunchy texture, you can add some non crushed pecans to the sauce instead.) I have figured out from other recipes that a good way to make things stick is to dredge the chicken in a thin coat of flour first, then dredge in the egg and last roll it in the outsid "", ' My husband says this is the best chicken recipe ever! I did change it a bit. I pounded the chicken flat and used goat cheese instead of brie. I have used brie also and I like both but I have some goat cheese in the house that I want to use up so I used that. You can cut the amount of brie in half and still have leftover cheese. I ground the pecans in the food process or until they are like bread crumbs. That way they stick to the chicken better. And then I bake the chicken instead of frying. I bake it at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. I use raspberry jam for the sauce mixed with chambord. I melt the jam on the stove and add the chambord. It is really good and saves time. This is my go to fancy chicken recipe. ', "" Might be the odd ball here, but I felt disappointed with this. The flavors just weren't there.

I also simmered the asparagus in the white wine with minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, and just a dab of butter for a richer flavor. Then, seeing that previous reviews had dubbed this recipe ""too dry,"" once the pasta was finished, I mixed in Sun Dried Tomato Alfredo sauce (from a jar, I digress) before adding my chicken and vegetables. I threw everything into my largest Pyrex mixing bowl, mixed it, and sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese over top... and popped it in a 250 oven for 20 minutes. The dish came out FANTASTIC.

I cooked the chicken in the olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, and kosher salt. When the chicken was about halfway done, I added about 1/4 cup of white wine. I added the asparagus to the boiling water with the pasta for the last 3 minutes of cooking. While the pasta was draining, I stirred in halved grape tomatoes into the chicken just to heat them through and then tossed everything together. I loved this light meal -- it was quick, easy, and delicious! "", ' As previous reviews have stated: this recipe is very dry and bland as is! I love asparagus so I decided to give it a second chance only ‘kicking it up a notch’ by sautéing one yellow pepper, ½ a medium size red onion, 1 cup sliced cherry tomatoes and 3 leaves of fresh basil along with the red pepper, asparagus and garlic. I also took other reader’s advice and added 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth to the pasta mixture. This was wonderful!!!! Sooo yummy I can’t wait to cook it again \uf04a The fresh basil really added to the spicy red pepper and garlic taste while the chicken broth kept things moist. Enjoy! ', "" The first time I made this I thought it was bland and the flavors didn't mix well. After experimenting several times this is my favorite new dish. This is what I did: I seasoned the chicken lightly with Lawry's Salt before sauteing it then I also doubled the garlic and pepper (I like garlic and spicy foods). I then used about 8-10 ounces of pasta and substituted the asparagus with some other greens (for example buck-choi) and then added the noodles to the chicken mixture and let it simmer in chicken broth. Topped off with parmesan it's excellent! "", ' Delicious! Easy to make and tasetd great too! ', "" This was my first real kitchen experience; mom was tired and it was MY turn to do dinner. As a 17-year-old I know I'm a bit behind in the cooking arena...honestly the most I'd ever attempted before was pancakes. So imagine the family's surprise when I was able to serve them this delicious and somewhat complicated-looking dish! Not to mention MY surprise when it all went smoothly...truly a quick and easy recipe. It was delicious and I can't wait to cook again. The only alteration I was brave enought to attempt was to use more than one tbl. spoon of olive oil to saute the chicken and to add a bit of salt while it was sizzling; it added a lot of flavor to the chicken very tasty!

The recipe calls for 2 packages of cream cheese but I only used one package. I also used red port wine instead of regular red wine. In my opinion, port wine has a more flavorful taste that I think is better paired with mushrooms.

Plus, although I ended up w/ 45 mushrooms in the end I only used the stems from the original 18 mushrooms for the stuffing mixture. Note when baking: When you place these mushrooms in your baking dish make sure you put them in there touching each other. If not then they may not stand up straight and roll over.

Two very important things to note: (1) depending on the pan size/temperature settings on your stove boiling for 7 minutes may not get the fudge to the right temp and if its not hot enough it will be runny and goopy. The easiest way to guarantee that your fudge sets up correctly is to use a candy thermometer and heat it to soft ball stage (235-240 degrees). I recommend an instant-read digital thermometer - so easy to use. (2)For those who have a hard time finding marshmallow creme (or want to save some ) 4 large marshmallows equals 1 oz of marshmallow creme so about 30 large marshmallows should do the trick here.

Drizzle the oil over the top of the stuffed chokes and steam until done. *~*How to eat the choke: Scrape the meat and stuffing off the leaves with your teeth until you get to the thin papery leaves. At that point you take a knife and cut at an angle around the edge of the paper white leaves. Take you fork and remove all the white feathery part and what you have left is the heart of the artichoke. Cut that into bite size pieces and enjoy!

You want to steam them so that the bread crumbs and cheeses meld together (SEE MY PHOTO). Make sure you used the grated Romano cheese and not the kind in the green can. The latter will ""clump up"" and not melt. TY for the recipe!! BTW I used Italian seasonings instead and dipped the leaves in olive oil upon partaking.

Then I stuffed and baked them in pan with about an 1 1/2 of water. Everyone LOVED them! ', "" this recipe is excellent. It is how my great grandparents used to make them with just a couple alterations to make it easier for the cook and just as delisious. First instead of using cubes of bread use Italian style bread crumbs so then the seasonings of parsley and oregano are already in the bread crumbs so you don't have to add them. Second slice the garlic very thin instead of mincing. The slices if sliced thin enough melt into the artichoke as it steams. Third use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and just drizzle slowly over the stuffed artichoke after stuffing. Fourth use a mixture of parmesean and romano cheese to sprinkle over the top after the olive oil drizzle. This makes a wonderful kind of crust over the entire artichoke that is excellent! "", ' This recipie is just like my grandma makes. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of chopped up salami in the stuffing (like grandma).

', ' This is an excellent recipe for stuffed artichokes (""i carciofi ripieni"") - a classic Italian dish whose proper preparation can at times be frustrating. An artichoke is the bud of a member of the thistle family. Tn the USA global artichokes cultivated in California are those most frequently available. The really successful end result of a cooked stuffed artichoke should provide leaves that are coated with almost homogeneously melted or amalgamated stuffing. However all too often the end result may be disappointing. Although the heart of an artichoke is almost always delicious the quality/ tenderness of the leaves may be otherwise. The ultimate success of any artichoke recipe (stuffed or non-stuffed)is absolutely dependent on the quality of the artichoke itself. Globe artichokes from California are available year round. However I limit my guarded purchases to the peak season - from March through May. I seek fist-sized (no larger) artichokes that are deep green - not brown are heavy for their size and have a tight leaf formation. The globe should squeak when the leaves are pressed together. Lack of satisfaction with your preparation of stuffed artichokes does not mean that you cannot enjoy artichokes - there are non-stuffed artichoke recipes that are simpler to prepare. Remember to include the trimmed stems in the recipe. When cooked they will be as delicious as the artichoke heart itself - the cynosure of all artichoke lovers. ', ' Excellent!! Excellent!!

I added 2 tbsp mustard seed and 1 tbsp celery seed to the mix. One thing you need to know, the cucumbers really reduce down once they have sat in the vinegar. I filled jars and processd them in a hot water bath, and when they came out the jars were only half full. I would let the mixture sit in the bowl for at least 2 hours and then fill your jars if you are going to process them. Thanks for the great recipe!! ', "" I rated these 4 stars because I made some modifications. I added 1 tbsp of mustard seed, 1 tsp of celery seed, and 1 tsp of turmeric (to make them bread and butter pickles). Also, not mentioned in the recipe but very important, if your brine doesn't cover your cucumbers, don't add extra water. The cucumbers will release water into the brine and then it will cover them. If this is your first time making pickles, here are a few notes so you can avoid the mistakes I made: 1. Don't use white onion, it's too strong. Use sweet or vidalia onions. 2. Slice the onion and green pepper into strips, don't dice them. If you dice them the flavour is too strong. 3. Cucumber sliced thinly (1/8-1/4 inch) will pickle in 1-2 days, and will stay crisp for 3-5 days. Cucumber sliced thickly (3/8-1/2 inch) will pickle in 3-4 days, and will stay crisp for a week or more. So if you want pickles now and later, do a jar of each. 4. If you use this brine to pickle other things (I did cauliflower, green peppers and asparagus) you need to use more brine on those vegetables than you did on the cucumber. I added water to the brine thinking that when I made cucumber pickles, they released water which added the extra liquid to the brine. That didn't work. You need to cover the almost completely, then finish with water, to make a strong enough brine for other vegetables. Steaming the vegetables first might help too, I haven't tried that yet.

Everyone at work was asking for the recipe. Even those who said they hated strawberries liked this recipe. I used an entire 8 oz. tub of whipped topping. Also, when making the jello, I dissolved the jello in 1/2 c. boiling water. Then, I added 1 c. of iced water to the jello and then stirred the jello until the ice melted.

So when you pour the jello part on the pretzels won\'t get soggy. Also once the cream cheese layer is on make sure it is room temp before pouring the jello part on. Mine jello was still a little hot when I poured it onto the cream cheese part that I had just taking out of the fridge and the hot jello cracked the cream cheese layer and seeped into the pretzels.

The entire dish bubbled and mixted together. It did not look the best but still tasted great. ', "" You can't go wrong with this pretzel salad everyone loves it. To the reviewer below you need the 3/4 c. butter so your pretzel crust doesn't stick to the pan. Also make sure your gelatin mixture isn't too liquidy before you pour over the pretzel crust. Let it thicken more than just 'slightly.' "", "" My mom has made a variation of this recipe for years and it's always a hit! I took it to Food Day at work and got rave reviews.

I think next time I'll use more pretzels for a thicker crust. From one Sarah to another thanks!

I use only 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup sugar 3oz of sugar-free cherry jello and 3oz box of regular cherry. It's less calories and still tastes great. "", ' Tastes good.

A tip from the chef at the party was to use good, thick bacon from the deli (not the prepackaged stuff); I tried a little of each type of bacon (just to see) and he was definitely right-the thicker bacon works much better, and I only used about 1/3 of a strip on each date-they were great! ', ' Amazing! I collected recipes during the year to make for Christmas 2001. I had an open house for several days and needed prepare-ahead recipes that I could pop in the oven or in the fryer as my guests arrived. My first batch of dates I tried as the recipe called for, in the oven. Cooking by this method made the bacon unevenly cooked. My husbad tried one and didn\'t care for the sweetness of the date. I almost chucked the whole heap of bacon wrapped dates and called it ""a lesson learned"". The next day I had the wok with hot oil cooking crab puffs and I decided to try deep frying a batch of the dates. It made a HUGE difference in the flavor and texture of the dates! My husband thought they were delicious now! They were no longer super sweet and the bacon was cooked evenly. I asked my closest friends to rate the appetizers from most favorite to least (I had at least a dozen to choose from) and these were number one with most of my fussy eaters.

I stuffed the dates a week ahead and left them in the fridge. I used 2 different kinds of dates. I recommend the ones found in the produce section, instead of the boxed and vaccuum sealed dates.

', ' This recipe is great!! I also tried using just water and a drop of food coloring. This made some beautiful sugar shapes when I found an old spoon with a shell shaped bowl. Demitasse spoons work well too for smaller shapes. The key is the consistency of the sugar. It should be like wet sand but kind of dryish. You only need a few drops of water to knead into the sugar. If it is too wet it will stick to the mold even if you use cornstarch. If using egg white I would just add a little at a time until I obtained the desired consistency. Experiment with the consistency so that is holds together after releasing from the mold. Be sure your mold is clean. You may have to clean it between the molding process. Just take the spoon with molded sugar tap it onto a cookie sheet to release the molded sugar and pop it in the oven. If the shapes are thicker like mine were you may need to leave it in the oven longer at 200 degrees. This works great. This is really very easy once you get the hang of it. ', "" I give this recipe 0 stars! It is the worst I have tried in a long time. I couldn't wait to wash my hands of sugar to get up here to write. The sugar did not stay together to unmold so I kept adding egg whites to the tune of 5 and IT STILL WOULD NOT HOLD THE SHAPE! I WASTED 5lbs af sugar and 5 eggs to do this. I am an accomplished baker who does not shy away from any decorative task and I could not make this work. Eeesch. Terrible directions! "", "" I gave this 4 stars because Nellie did and I used her recipe. I used the sugar for small candy size fleur de lis molds that I was using to decorate a cake. It worked very well with the small molds but when I tried to use it on the larger sucker sized molds I couldn't get them out of the molds w/out cracking or breaking even after dusting the mold w/ cornstarch. "", ' This is a good primer for people who are beginners in sugar crafting. The thing is that depending on what you\'re making what time of year it is (temp and esp humidity in your kitchen will always make a difference!) and most importantly what works best for you specifically you will find that with time and practice you will understand what works best for you with regard to ingredients and the quantity of each. For instance I\'ve been working with sugar molding for many years. I\'ve made these eggs in different sizes and I\'ve made countless decorations for cakes and so forth. What works for me depends on what I\'m making; the size the texture I want in the finished molds color and how stable the pieces must be when they are finished. In the case of these eggs I do want the sugar granule texture to show so I use half regular sugar and half superfine. If I\'m making letters numbers or flowers and other small cake decorations I use all superfine or half super and half powdered. In any case I never use egg whites. I prefer using meringue powder and water mixed to the consistency that is right for me. It makes for a stable ""glue"" with no variable consistency unlike egg whites. I suggest using food color pastes versus liquid color. It\'s definitely more true to color takes less amt and is buildable up to very intense vivid shades. Use the ratios of sugars to liquids above as a guide you can always add more of anything as you get a feel for the work. Build color slowly. ', "" This is not a complete recipe.

I also tried a new technique and bought baby spinach in a package and didn't cook it. I layered the noodles, cheese mix and spaghetti sauce with the fresh spinach, packing in quite a bit of the fresh stuff. It turned out pretty well! And it saved a step (and a pan). Also used no-boil noodles for the first time, and was surprised to find that they actually do work pretty well (and save another step and pan).

"", "" Can't say enough about this recipe. (I finally registered on this site after years so that I could rate this one!) The Ricotta/Mushroom/Spinach filling was the key. (TIP: This filling is Fantastic used to stuff/ bake with Salmon.) And like others I am sure I used a load more spinach. Don't worry about people not liking the spinach, because my husband the Carnivore was fighting with his picky brother for the leftovers! By the way, this freezes well! I froze it uncooked and baked from frozen at temp stated. My only changes: didn't have the romano and added a tad bit of FRESH grated nutmeg to the spinach. And make sure you use a good (not overpowering) sauce. Thanks Robbie! "", "" This was delicious. I followed another reviewer's tips and sauteed artichokes with the onions and garlic and also added extra tomato sauce with each layer to keep it moist. I also doubled the boiled spinach and even added fresh spinach to each layer and it was so good. I used 5 pieces of lasagna for each of the three layers. I also removed the foil 5-7 minutes before the end of the hour to let the cheese bubble up and crust a little. Everyone LOVED it and the leftovers were ridiculously good. Will definitely make again.

I went to grab leftovers out of the fridge for lunch the next day, and they had already been consumed by people who made fun of me and my hippie lasagna. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was amazing! My roommate is a vegetarian, so we decided to try this one night. I wasn\'t keen on the idea because I\'d tried many terrible meatless lasagnas in the past. But, one bite and I was hooked. You barely even notice that it\'s lacking a meat flavor. I did make some changes...I used light cheese and had to use cooked frozen spinach because fresh was banned at the time. We used Prego sauce. I also forgot to add the egg. We had a lot of filling left, probably because we like thin layers. I\'d recommend this recipe...even to people who love meaty lasagna! ', "" My picky-eater girlfriend won't touch mushrooms, so I substituted brocolli. To spare a few steps and dirty dishes, I sauteed the brocolli with the onions, then added the spinach to cook. Then, after allowing some time to cool, I stirred the cheeses, egg, and herbs right into the veggies in the pan. No electric mixer needed. "", ' After many concerns and no answers on other reviews here are my own answers after finishing the recipe: YES you can make ahead, I stored mine uncooked in the fridge overnight and cooked it next day for dinner, just don’t cook the noodles; buy pre-cooked and add a little bit more sauce. YES you can use cottage cheese, just drain it for a while and press it so most of the water comes off the taste is very similar to ricotta and cheaper. YES you can add a layer of meat, just cook it with a little minced garlic and olive oil. NO the spinach is not enough, add 1 more cup. And finally YES you can cook the spinach with the mushroom/onion mix. ', ' how do you fit five lasagna noodles in the bottome of a 9x13 pan. This recipe has more noodles than anything else.

Also I only had one pkg of cream cheese so I had to adjust the ingredients accordingly. For the Crust: The wafer cookies were too small for regular muffin size and too big for mini-muffin size. So I crushed 20 wafer cookies and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. After lining the muffin pans with cupcake papers I put tablespoon full of crushed cookies to each muffin pan. I had exact amount of crushed cookies for 12 cupcakes. I used a measuring cup which fit nicely in the muffin pan to press the crushed cookies to the bottom. Very easy!

I had Kheer for the first time yesterday at an Indian restaurant. I liked it so much that I immediately came home and started looking for a recipe. I used this recipe and it was just as delicious as what I had at the restaurant. I made it almost exactly like the recipe except for just a couple of minor changes. For example I only had cardamom seeds in my pantry so I crushed these and added approximately 1/2 of a teaspoon in place of the cardamom pods. This worked out very well and gives it a delicious flavor. The rose water is a very nice and subtle addition but I'm sure the Kheer would still be delicious if you don't have any on hand. I noticed that a previous reviewer thought that it needed more rice but I think this is probably the correct amount. The one that I had at the restaurant didn't even have this much rice in it. It was almost soupy enough to drink which I presume is the way it is supposed to be. Since I was somewhat rushed I didn't take time to soak the rice but just rinsed it a few times in cold water. That seemed to be sufficient and I don't think it made much of a difference. I cooked mine uncovered as I was afraid that it would boil over and I couldn't watch it the whole time. I just kept it on a low simmer and stirred it now and then. This is a very sweet dessert and you can safely reduce the sugar just a tad if you prefer. I used sliced almonds which had been toasted lightly. This is good warm but is even better after "", ' this recipe is alright but its much better when you substitute half of the milk with coconut milk and you can get by with only 3 T. of sugar and half the amount of rose water 1/2 tsp. of cardamom. ', ' This is the reply to the first review.You can substitute 1/4 teaspoon cardomom powder. This is the reply to the other review regarding milk quantity.Use the milk as advised because the milk needs to be boiled for longer which produces a rich taste and the quantity of milk is reduced with prolonged boiling. ', ' This was pretty good. I used the rice/milk proportion that the recipe called for and cooked the kheer uncovered. I worried that the kheer was too thin so I raised the heat and boiled some of the milk off. However when the kheer cooled it was too thick. So I think the rice/milk proportion stated in the recipe is correct. Also the rose water has a very strong flavor; I was not very careful measuring it and so the rose water overwhelmed the cardamom flavor. And I mixed in raisins &amp; slivered almonds in the end. Overall this is a very good recipe. ', ' I am wondering if the ratio of milk and rice is correct. 2 quarts of milk to 1/4 cup of rice seems to be off. I had to use less milk by about a quart and a quarter.. The flavor is wondeful though. ', "" Addictive flavor. Although it takes time this is a very easy recipe with simple healthful ingredients. The timing of soaking the rice is important. If you soak the rice for too long then it won't absorb enough of the milk and it will turn out too watery. I substituted 4 tsp ground cardamom for the 4 pods which might be a little much but I love cardamom. Be sure to stir the pudding while sprinkling the cardamom on so that it doesn't clump. I omitted the almonds and it tasted great. "", "" This recipe is exactly like the Kheer we get in our favorite Indian restraunt. I searched all over to try to find the right recipe. It's EXCELLENT! My husband can't get enough. Although he likes to just drink the milk and leave the rice. "", ' Wow this is so good and so authentic! Exactly like what is served at Indian restaurants...even better! I like the addition of the almonds. I used basmati rice and lightly toasted the almonds. I had my doubts about the rose water because it smells so ""perfumey""...but it really accents the pudding beautifully. I also cut back on the sugar a little...I used 1 1/4 cups. The recipe as it is scaled makes a lot of pudding...it doesn\'t cook down much since there is no boiling involved. Next time I will scale down by half since I am the only one in my family who likes pudding (I just don\'t get it)! Shazia I make your Pasanday often and now this will be a regular treat too!

"", ' I changed the recipe a bit..But they turnd out scrumptious!! I used HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS for the cereal..And added peanut butter chips instead of peanut butter and then I greased 12 cupcake cups and then packed the mixture in them and let them cool in the fridge..YUMMMMMMY!!! =) ', "" Rich? Yes. Declicious? Absolutely. These were the first to disappear of all the cookies I made for Thanksgiving and I've been asked for the recipe twice. I also added a drizzle of chocolate (and one of white chocolate) for both flavor and aesthetics and used chunky peanut butter mostly because I had it on hand but I'll be using it again; the peanuts added a nice touch. I recommend keeping the drops small - they are very rich - and maybe crushing the corn flakes a little bit to help with that. Also if you have a food scale weigh out the 4 cups (112g) rather than using measuring cups - my friend who cup-measured said he ended up with too few flakes and they turned out runny. "", ' I also love this recipe but have always made it a little differently. We called them butterscotch bonbons; we put 3 c. cornflakes 3 c. mini marshmallows 1 pkg. b. chips 1 c. peanut butter. Love it! ', "" These were easy to make and have a good flavor mix with the peanut butter and butterscotch chips. I took these to our cookie exchange at work and one of the ladies just flipped over them saying this was what her grandmother made her when she was little. Brought back great memories for her. The only downfall is you can't leave them out for too long as they get sticky but still good choice for a quick easy treat. "", ' I added a little Gulf Wax and they stayed set perfectly. These are AWESOME! ', ' these were fantastic! and super easy - ten minutes tops. i put them in the little truffle cups for more even distribution.. they tend to spread out if not contained. i also used the crunchy pb as the other review recommended. yummers!.tj. ', "" Excellent tasting very easy to make. The only thing I would mention is that the mix is slightly runny when it's mixed and you drop the blobs on the cookie sheet. I wasn't sure they were going to stick together but once cooled they came out fine. They were somewhat difficult to get off the cookie sheet though several of them broke when I scraped them off. Maybe spraying the cookie sheet with PAM first would help? Otherwise great! "", ' Great idea!! Although I didn\'t quite follow the recipe. I have never had anything like this before and the cornflakes sounded/looked weird to me. Instead I made the melt and then dipped bite-sized ""waffle"" shaped pretzles in covering them half way. Delicious!! I did half the recipe and it took about 10 minutes to dip 50 pretzs. ', "" I'm giving this 3 stars because my son loved them but they were way too rich for me. I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled over the top to try to counter the butterscotch flavor but it didn't help much. I ended up throwing away half the batch. Sorry.

Then I used three thinly sliced pats of butter evenly spaced on each fillet. Total would be abt. 3 Tbsp. (So 1/2 c. of butter is w-a-y too much!)

"", "" I've always loved and relied upon a similar version of this for a quick and delicious fish dinner (cod or any mild white flaky fish can also be used). However I love a golden brown color so I always give it a a shake of paprika and bake quickly on high heat about 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees. The lemon pepper seasoning on fish was something new for me and it was interesting to try. It was okay but for me a little overpowering. I'll stick with the lemon juice dill garlic or California garlic salt paprika and salt and pepper. This recipe has great potential but unfortunately gets only three stars from me for the microwaving and the lemon pepper neither of which are positive contributions. "", "" Sorry but in my opinion this was a waste of nice fresh haddock fillets. Neither one of us like this. It was dry and bland and will not make again.

"", "" Meh. I had a very different take on this recipe from most. Incorporating the suggestions of many reviewers I used half whole wheat and half bread flour. The bread was good not great certainly nothing that rocked my world. It was moist and the flavor was OK. However I'd suggest that the last 1/2 cup of water is unnecessary and contributes to a very sticky dough. Even after adding another 3/4 cup flour to try to give the dough some body it was still soft. I went ahead with it which I now know I shouldn't have done. There wasn't sufficient structure to support the loaf when it rose (I did not experience the problems others reported of the dough not rising.) It looked gorgeous nice and high. But as soon as the heating element kicked on in the bread machine POOF! it all deflated. The result was a relatively flat loaf - the outsides were higher than the middle which was less than attractive. That aside as I said the flavor was still reasonably good and let's face it: homemade bread even so-so homemade bread still tastes wonderful when fresh. I suspect that if I had left out the later addition of water the results would be a lot lighter and higher.

The bread was good not great certainly nothing that rocked my world. It was moist and the flavor was OK. However I'd suggest that the last 1/2 cup of water is unnecessary and contributes to a very sticky dough. Even after adding another 3/4 cup flour to try to give the dough some body it was still soft. I went ahead with it which I now know I shouldn't have done. There wasn't sufficient structure to support the loaf when it rose (I did not experience the problems others reported of the dough not rising.) It looked gorgeous nice and high. But as soon as the heating element kicked on in the bread machine POOF! it all deflated. The result was a relatively flat loaf - the outsides were higher than the middle which was less than attractive. That aside as I said the flavor was still reasonably good and let's face it: homemade bread even so-so homemade bread still tastes wonderful when fresh. I suspect that if I had left out the later addition of water the results would be a lot lighter and higher. Because of the extra pain-in-the-butt step to allow the oats to steep for an hour this is just too fussy a recipe for me to want to try again. I'm going to cut my losses on this one and move on.

I decided to give this one a try after just not finding one quite thick enough or creamy enough. This was perfect. The consistency was excellent. I have made it numerous times now. I have upped the cocoa to almost 1/2 cup to prevent the caramel taste and give it a richer chocolate taste. I have also (after reading some reviews) added in a handful of semisweet choc chips. A tip to save on dishes and time is to use a hand blender while boiling on the stove instead of using a blender after cooking. I'm keeping this recipe and will be giving this out for Christmas gifts this year. "", ' Another tip to follow up... We discovered that if you use only 1-1/3 cup of butter, it is slightly less thick and has less of a carmelized consistency and more like fudge rather than caramel. Also, for the left-over sauce, it is not grainy and does not crystalize. Try it! ', "" Totally to LIVE FOR!!!! I don't rate many recipes 5 stars but this deserves MORE! This was so easy to make. The only thing I did was to halve the recipe. My only caution would be if you have a blender that is made of plastic instead of glass and pouring in the hot liquid. I had a glass blender and had no problems. If you LOVE chocolate you need to try this one! This would be great with fruit or fondue. This is FANTASTIC just eating off the spoon when slightly cooled or even COLD the next day!! I served with buttermilk pound cake II recipe. "", "" Five stars with these adjustments: Used only 1/2 cup of butter, only 2 cups of sugar, and increased the cocoa powder to about 1/2 cup. It did not crystallize in the fridge with this method. So much better than any hot fudge I've found in a store! "", "" Ohhhh yum. This was a PERFECT ending to a HORRIBLE day! Even though when I was making it, it boiled over the pot all over my stove, which indeed was my fault, because against my better judgement I opted to use the smaller pot and of coarse the obvious happened (I'm having a really bad day) the end result of this was worth every bit! THANK YOU Lisa, this was the best part of my day, my P.J.s, A bowl of Breyers vanilla with your hot fudge sauce...and a nice cold beer!! "", ' Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!! Make sure to blend the sauce-I have done it both ways-trying a shortcut once of not blending. The blending makes for the richest smoothest sauce. I like to serve this over fudge brownies for brownie sundaes-yum! ', ' I made this last year for Christmas gifts and I already have them asking for this again this year. Starting making batches last night. I double the recipe and it almost makes 5 pints. In a double batch I use 1.5 cups of the Cocoa, 1Tbs vanilla and boil for 9-10 minutes. This gives a rich dark chocolate flavor. If you like milk chocolate then use a little less. Blending is the key as the cocoa will be grainy out of the pan. Blend it for at least a few minutes or until it becomes think and strains your blender. Also when reheating I use a measuring cup with water and put the hot fudge in the water or you can use a single serving in the microwave. This keeps the hot fudge from crystalizing.

The mussels were easy and quick to prepare . . .and tasted delicious. I used Clamato and added a bit more clam juice, and the mussels just sucked up all the flavors. The dipping sauce created at the end was a wonderful touch. I suggest using New Zealand mussels. ', "" Very tasty! I only used 0.5 cups of wine to 1 cup of Clamato, as I was running low on wine. Besides, I wanted the main flavour to be the Clamato... I also added some salt &amp; few hearty dashes of Tabasco sauce to the liquid before cooking the mussels. (My idea was to make the broth like a spicy Bloody Ceasar cocktail.) The clamato really gives the mussels a kick that is a nice change from the classic garlic/wine French method. I did use the butter in the recipe, but I find it doesn't thicken the sauce that much anyway, and it almost tasted better before I added the butter, so this step will be optional for me in the future. I had lots of leftovers, so will add some diced tomatoes &amp; tomato paste to the mussel meat and broth and turn it into a pasta sauce another night. What a great way to enjoy mussels, thanks for the recipe -- I will be sure to make this again and again! "", "" Absolutely Fabulous. The flavor, appearance and ease of preparation make this dish simply delicious. I made only minor changes: 1 cup clam/tomato juice and 1/2 cup white wine(instead of 3/4C of each), I did add 1 can of chopped tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer and I reduced the liquid before adding the mussels. I can't wait to make it again. "", ' I made this recipe without altering the directions at all and they were excellent! Make sure you have a BIG loaf of french bread on hand to sop up the juices!

Anyways great bread! ', ' My family and I loved this bread, my husband is Italian and he loves bread. We go to a little local Italian shop where they make fresh bread and it is amazing, this recipe came very close to it. I have been on a bread making kick for the past 2 years and have all kinds of bread making books one even from Le Cordon Bleu and this recipe ranks right up there. The crust was chewy and golden, this bread is little dense but delicious, a perfect bread in my humble opinion. The only alteration I made was to only add 1tsp of salt. I would not make the whole recipe in the bread machine because it is a bit of a dense bread and it will turn out too heavy. This recipe is now one of favorites, thanks for sharing Destiny! a little tip how do you know when the bread has risen enough? The dough will double in size. It will be soft and look a bit airy. When you touch it with your finger, it will feel soft and an indention in the dough will remain. If it feels a bit springy and the dough bounces back from the indentation, it hasn’t risen enough.

"", ' I just LOVE this bread! The egg brushed on it right before baking makes it shiny and beautiful. When cutting the top of it b4 baking I tend to cut diagonally both ways rather than one cut down the middle; impressive look. 1 t. gluten/cup flour makes it even softer. My family and friends love this too!! ', "" OMG! This bread is sooo good it disappeared right off the table in no time. I tweaked it a bit after reading some reviews. I used my bread machine to make the dough and my oven to bake it. First, I put in warm water and yeast and let it stand for 10 min. This activates the yeast. Then I added all the ingrediants, making sure to add the salt last (on top). I used half All-Purpose flour and half Bread flour. I also reduced the salt to a rounded tsp. I set my bread machine for the rapid french coarse. This worked better than the dough setting which only allows one rise. I set a timer to remind me to take it out before the machine started baking. This gave the dough more needing and rising cycles. As many have suggested, I divided and shaped the dough and let it rise on the baking stone or pan (because transfering your dough can possibly make it flatten) which I covered with parchment paper and a sprinkling of cornmeal. You know the dough is ready to bake when it is soft and leaves an indentation when gently poked. If the indentation fills back in let it rise some more. Rise range 40-60min. I applied the egg solution using a paper towel softly brushing the dough. I think this is better than using a stiff brush because the dough can easily flatten. I pre-heated my oven to 400 and when I was ready to put in the bread I turned it down to 375. I didn't use the water or ice cube at the bottom of the oven as some have suggested (I forgot). But my crust came out crispy, flaky, perfect! "", ' Excellent and easy!!!! Why buy it anymore Made it several times `` Will never buy italian bread again ', "" The bread tasted fine.

Instead of using 1/2 cup of corn I used a can of corn water and all. Because of the water in the corn and the juice from the can of clams I didn't add the cup of water to the soup before letting it simmer and it came out perfectly. I also added some hot red pepper flakes for a little heat and thought the sweetness of the corn and the spicy pepper complimented each other well. This one's so good and so easy to make. I can't recommend it enough. "", "" The best tomato soup that I've ever made. "", "" I don't really understand why people liked this recipe. I didn't care for it and I did everything the recipe said. Very disappointed! "", "" This is incredibly popular in my house. I made a batch (again) last night and most of it is gone - and there are just 3 of us. Changes I make: 2 instead of one can of clams; 1 15-oz can of diced tomatoes in place of 2 of the cans of tomato sauce; and either I add a bit of crushed red pepper or one of the cans of tomato sauce I do use is Goya picante (hot) flavored tomato sauce (because practically anything with tomatoes is better with a little pepper even if it's so little you can't put your finger on what's there). Oh and I use a 12-oz can condensed milk instead of cream and dried instead of fresh basil (because they're always in my pantry like all the other ingredients of this soup). "", "" The tomato sauce was a bit overpowering so I would next time use 2 or 3 cans 2 cups of milk(I used milk instead of cream) instead of one( we all ended up adding milk to all of our bowls to eat this soup because the tomato sauce was so strong!) add some chopped tomatoes instead definitely go with a whole cup each of corn and red onion and honestly I was disappointed becasue the clams didn't make an impact at all. If you do want the soup to be more about the clams add at least one or two more cans. But what I'm going to do is save my money and not buy the clams next time and just enjoy a creamy tomato soup. Oh and the butter--totally useless. Usually in most recipes I tend to reduce the butter and I thought about doing that for this recipe and bringing it down to one TB but I was afraid I would sacrifice flavor so I went ahead and used it. However since I couldn't taste any hint of it through the overwhelming taste of tomato sauce I'm sure even sauteeing the onions in a little EVOO would have done the trick. Overall good recipe just a little too tomato saucey and not much else. ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22830

I added 1/8 tsp ground pepper since the flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me.

I used margarine instead of butter and homogenized milk instead of heavy cream. I did not need to use any thickening agents-the consistency was just right. Just toss with fettucine and serve. ', "" You would not believe how incredible this sauce is! My husband and I made this sauce (served over fettuccine noodles) for my friend and her husband, as they just had their third child a few days ago and we figured they could use the break from cooking - they went nuts, they loved it so much! Even their two younger sons (3 and 2) loved this dish. It literally tastes IDENTICAL to the sauce that they serve at the Olive Garden. Another good tip is to add a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce - it really tastes great. I'd give this 6 stars if I could - I will NEVER buy alfredo sauce again! The next time I might use milk and a little cornstarch instead of the cream (as one previous reviewer suggested) and perhaps reduced fat margarine to save on fat and calories. Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan (available in bags in the dairy section), Kraft grated just doesn't do it as well - and the shredded parm melts really well. ENJOY this incredible dish! Thank you, Rebecca! :) "", "" Very good flavor in this recipe, but I did add a 2nd clove of garlic. If you just stir the cream into the butter and let it simmer, it will seperate. I gently whisk the cream and butter the entire time it's simmering and whisk while adding the cheese (a little at a time) and it doesn't seperate, even after a day in the fridge. The consistency is a little hard to get smooth, but probably because parmesan is a very hard cheese with a granular texture to begin with, and doesn't melt smoothly. I used a parmesan/asiago blend and it was beautifully smooth after lots of whisking. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter - if you use margarine or lightly salted butter, it's way too salty. I used this recipe to make a white chicken lasagna, which was absolutely delicious, and it held up well in the refrigerator to have leftovers the next day. "", ' Holy Moly! My husband loves alfredo, and he freaked out because this was so good. I made a double recipe, added 1.5 pounds of pan seared chicken breast and poured it over tri-color rotini (it was the only pasta in the house). Unbelievable! It was a little thin at first, but thickened as it cooled. I used genuine Parmesan Reggiano and it melted wonderfully smooth--just be sure to add only a handful at a time. Do not boil, or the sauce will separate. ', "" Bland &amp; throughly uninspired.

I made the alfrado using the Gruyere cheese, then in a separate skillet sauted 4 chopped green onions, 1T crushed garlic, and 2T fresh chopped parsley in 2T olive oil, added 1lb cleaned devained shrimp and 1 can lump crab meat over medium heat until shrimp turned pink then folded into the alfrado sauce and served over linguini. ', "" I tried this recipe using 2 different types of parmesan cheese, the shredded kind and the finely grated kind (think Kraft green container). The shredded was SOOO much better, though both times I used a bit more cream and a bit less cheese. I used equal amounts and added about a 1/4 cup of cream extra and did about a 1/4 cup less cheese. We served it with grilled chicken (marinade in Itailian dressing)and grilled red peppers. YUM! Thanks for the recipe. Ths was the best alfredo I've ever had! "", ' Very good basic Alfredo sauce. Remember to keep the sauce at a slow simmer, and never bring to the boil. The high heat will cause the cheese to turn grainy... a slow simmer will keep it smooth and creamy. Note: A simmer is where the temperature of the liquid is just below the boiling point, or where small bubbles come to the surface and break gently. You could try different cheeses... why not, or you could substitute the parsley with another herb, such as, Cilantro. Oh, and I enjoy a bit more garlic... keeps the Vampires away.

So I used chicken cutlet that I added salt &amp; pepper to and then dredged in flour, shaking off any excess. This made my sauce really nice as it cooked and kept the thin chicken moist and it looked great. This allowed me to cut down on the cooking time by 20 minutes!The thin chicken needed less o.j. to cover. Before putting my chicken in the baking dish, I lightly browned the onions in a tablespoon or two of butter.

I also used a sprinkle of crushed red pepper after covering the chicken with the o.j. When it came time to make my sauce I did not use more o.j, but instead used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also reserved a tablespoon of the brown sugar that goes on the chicken at the end. I used that to sweeten my sauce to my taste and only used barely 1/2 of that TBS.

I was curious to see how this cookie would be because of the range of ratings from one star to five. As promised the cookies turned out crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. If you are looking for a ""all-over"" chewy cookie (not crisp at all and more soft) then this recipe is NOT for you. Also if you are looking for a sugar cookie to roll and cut-out this may not be the recipe. The dough is awfully sticky. I did change a couple of things: I used butter instead of margarine and after the first batch I quit rolling them in the sugar (it was too sweet for me!) Otherwise the cookies turned out deliciously buttery and the texture is still the same on the second day. Good tips from others: if the dough is too sticky to handle refrigerate it. My only beef is that the cookies are fairly thin; this recipe would be even better with if it produced a super thick chewy crispy sugar cookie. ', ' NOTE: We have change the 1 teaspoon baking powder in this recipe to 1 teaspoon baking soda, as requested by the recipe submitter. - The Staff ', "" These cookies are wonderful and very tasty. Please take my advise however. First, try to use butter instead of margarine. The second is that these cookies need about 1/2 cup extra of flour. That will give you a total of 3 1/4 cups of flour. The first time I made them, they came out flat. I was very surprised that more people didn't comment on this issue, but I promise that my advise will give you the best cookie. :) "", "" ok, somehow I deleted my first review for these cookies... basically all I said was that these are really good, I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes and these are among the top two, the other one being Cracked Sugar Cookies I. These are nice and soft. Make sure you don't cook them too long, they are done when you just start to see a little color, kind of a yellowish color, but very slight, don't worry they will harden! The dough and the cookies themselves taste kind of like the Break 'n Bake that you can buy in the grocery stores! So, thanks so much, Cindy! It's been a couple of weeks since I posted the above statements--I made both this recipe and Cracked sugar cookies I and compared them. I took one bite of one and then one bite of the other--this is definently the best sugar cookie recipe I have EVER tasted. There is no lack of flavor, these are so awesome! They look good, taste good. You don't even need frosting. They kind of remind me of Sugar Cookies that you can buy at Subway. I just want to encourage anyone looking for a chewy, soft, yummy sugar cookie to TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!! I give these ************************* 25 stars!!!! I wonder what they would be like with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts???? I might try that...if I do, I'll let you know... "", ' THESE WERE THE BEST SUGAR COOKIES EVER!!!!!!! I think they taste the BEST when JUST baked... so I keep the dough in a container and everytime I make them I just use the dough.. itz REALLY easy too. Also.. I added 1 teaspoon of corn starch.

Thank you for the base recipe! "", ' This was a hit at my house. I found it easy and excellent. I did cheat though and instead of making the gravy I used 2 packs of brown gravy mix. I assure you this was the right amount of gravy and not dry. Will make again. But I do think using fresh veggies and not frozen is a biggie. ', ' This is a good overall recipe. I did make a some changes. First, I added some seasoning (rosemary, sage, white pepper, thyme) to the raw meat before searing (locks in some flavorful juices). Then, I used a combination of water and dry red wine to stew the meat (skim any scum off). I removed the meat after it was done then cooked my vegetables in the same liquid as the beef (add water &amp; salt as necessary) . By doing this it will give you a better tasting gravy which will need less cornstarch because the vegetable starches which will help to act as a thickening agent. Adjust the salt, white pepper and seasonings to taste. I also added sliced mushrooms at the end. I have found that if you increase your vegetables slightly, you will have enough for 2 pies. I used a homemade double crust to which I added about a teaspoon each of dried rosemary, thyme and some pinches of salt &amp; white pepper to the flour before cutting in the shortening. It really makes a big difference. ', "" I prepared and froze this dish for my 'once-a-month cooking' group--I thawed and cooked my pot pie this evening, and it was great! I made a few changes to the recipe that made it a good bit easier--I used a frozen green pea/carrot mix for the veggies, and I also used frozen cubed hash brown potatoes for the potatoes. Since I was going to be freezing my pies, I didn't precook the veggies at all (didn't even thaw them!), just added them into the pie and covered with gravy--it was a lot easier! I also added some undiluted cream mushroom soup and dry brown gravy mix to the sauce, and was then able to omit the cornstarch. My family enjoyed this a lot, even my 19-month-old! Thanks "", "" Everyone LOVED this pie. Adjustments: I left out the peas and added a can of sliced mushrooms. I used the broth from the simmered meat (yielded one cup)in addition to the can of beef broth. After the potatoes and carrots (and I added a large diced onion) were cooked there wasn't much broth left. I also added 1/3 cup of red wine to the gravy. The flavor of this pie was outstanding. My crusts cooked for one hour at 375 degrees so plan according to the directions on the box! I'm going to try this pie filling in a crock pot the next time. "", "" The recipe is good but I made a couple of changes which made it easier for me. I dredged the meat in flour and seasoning before browning. It made a wonderful gravy which I used to cook the vegatables. I didn't have to use the broth or the cornstarch. I also added celery and onion to the vegetables. I also cooked it in a caserole dish with only a top crust. My family loved it! "", "" I used leftover grilled steak-really worth grilling up extra steaks just for this.

My insurance policy when making any fudge that is cooked like this is to add 2-3 T. white Karo. I learned this from Alton Brown on the Food Network on one of his fudge shows. It doesn't affect the taste of any fudge and the different type of sugar, or glucose, will prevent the other sugar crystals from clumping together which accounts for the graininess. You can also substitute a 10.5 oz. bag of miniature marshmallows for the marshmallow creme which makes this step a whole lot easier. This is a variation on the Fantasy Fudge that has been around for years. "", ' We have many small-town candy/fudge shops in northern Minnesota. My favorite fudge has always been \'orange cream\'. This recipe is as close to ""Up North"" fudge as one could get. This fudge is awesome; smooth, tasty, an delicious. A bonus is that it is easy to make. A definite ""keeper"" recipe. ', "" I wanted this recipe so badly but it turns out grainy both times I've made it. What am I doing wrong?????? Wonderful flavor if I could just get the creamy part right. "", "" Delicious delicious delicious! I'd never heard of orange cream fudge before and was a little worried about how it might come out, but it was easy to make. I used confectioner's sugar like someone else suggested and I had no problems with the fudge being grainy or cracking. We can't stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe! "", ' Wonderful recipe! I also made it with strawberry flavoring although it takes about double the amount to get enough strawberry flavor. Everyone raved about both. This year I am trying it with raspberry and also banana flavoring. Update 11/29/16: I use powdered sugar as others had suggested and it came out nice and creamy. Used 1 and 3/4 cups of packed powdered for each of cup of granulated needed. ', "" Grainy grainy GRAINY and I used a superfine sugar and stirred away trying to disolve the sugar but end result was still grainy. Used a candy thermo AND a digital and did measurements by weight so I was accurate and still it was grainy. And I didn't find it as orangey as it could have been either but it was sickeningly sweet. It was however the right consistency hence the 2 stars. What a waste (of ingredients AND time!). Did NOT make the cut for my holiday treats baskets... too bad so sad.

"", "" I like this recipe, but like others I modified it some to better suit my family's tastes. Almost seems a shame to review it based on my modifications because if I had all the ingredients on hand to make it as is, I am sure it would have been great as well. That being said, I used 5 cups chicken broth instead of the broth/water mix, substituted black pepper and reduced dill to 1/8 tsp, substituted 2% milk for the half and half cream and omitted the evaporated milk altogether. I also fried the bacon separately from the onion, sauteing the onion instead in olive oil with about a 1 c of carrots and a stalk of celery. Then I added both the bacon and the vegetables to the slowcooker together for step 2. I did also puree about 1/4 of the soup and about a 1/4 cup of potato flakes to thicken it some before step 3. Family loved it, particularly the children. As far as cooking the bacon in the slowcooker for that amount of time, I didn't experience any problems as far as the soup being greasy or overpowered by the taste. The bacon was soft though. If you prefer crispy bacon in your soup definitely wait to add it. "", "" I wasn't so sure this would be a four star recipe as I was making it but it turned out well in the end. I wish I had followed another reviewer's advice and fried the bacon first then set it aside and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease. Cooking them at the same time didn't work so well because the onions were done well before the bacon leading to burned onions which in turn led to brown soup. Next time I'd add the onions at the beginning but wait to serve the bacon with each individual bowl. It gets soggy being in the broth. I also had to bump up the slow cooker to high for awhile because the potatoes just weren't getting soft enough. After I added the flour half and half and evaporated milk I expected the soup to get really thick and creamy but it stayed pretty thin even after adding more flour and bumping the slow cooker back up to high again. So I transferred everything to a pot on the stove and cooked it at a little bit higher temperature being careful not to boil it. Even then it never did get quite as thick as other potato soups I've had. The flavor did turn out great after adding more salt and dill weed. My husband and I both really liked it and it's not as fattening as other potato soups especially using fat-free half and half and fat-free evaporated milk. I'd make this recipe again but I'd probably do it all on the stove instead of in the slow cooker. "", ' This is a great recipe. I used it when we did family poker night with my in-laws. I followed other user suggestions and did not add the bacon until the very end and also substituted heavy cream for half and half. I sauteed my onion in butter instead of bacon grease so there would not be brown flecks in my soup. Also we all added a generous spoonful of cheddar cheese before eating. This is like a giant stuffed baked potato in a bowl!!!! Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers! ', ' I love potato soup and potato soup with bacon is heaven! I substitute milk for the cream because otherwise it seems so creamy it is like a white sauce instead of soup. ', ' This made an excellent tasting soup. I didn\'t have condensed chicken broth so I used 2 cans of non-condensed chicken broth 1 chicken bouillon cube instead (still added the listed 2 cups of water). When the potatoes were done...blended some of them in the blender along with the flour and half-and-half mixture and part of the evaporated milk. Then just put that back in the crockpot along with the rest of the evaporated milk for 30 more minutes. Added a little more salt pepper onion and garlic powder to taste...and served with shredded cheddar and ""Real Bacon Bits"" in a jar on the side. Also wanted to speed it up a little so cooked it for 3 hours on high then 2 hours 20 minutes on Low in a 6-1/2 qt crockpot. Thanks for this great recipe Shirley! Will definitely be making it again. ', "" This recipe is so great! It's thick creamy and very filling. I am going to halve the recipe next time for just two people. I used the slow cooker for mine with no problem... I even had it cooking on high for 3.5 hours without realizing it and thought I ruined it but didn't thankfully. I don't know why/how other people had runny watery soup but I had no problem. I didn't cook the onions beforehand I just put them in the cooker raw. I also didn't put in the bacon either I saved it to garnish when we were ready to eat (I used ready-to-eat bacon which you can heat up in the microwave for however many you need/want - so convenient). Also added shredded cheese as a garnish too. I put a couple pinches of crushed red pepper flakes and a garlic clove minced to add more zing and flavor. I used lowfat evaporated milk and regular half and half. I also used reduced sodium chicken broth as well. The grocery store didn't have large potatoes unbagged... so I used 8 red-skinned medium-sized potatoes instead. I also mashed half the potatoes as well before I added the creamy mixture. Mm Mm Mm. Thank you for sharing! It was perfect for a cool fall day! "", "" A winter party hit! I loved this soup! It was creamy and delicious - the bacon stays crispy and everyone at my party loved it. I made it a second time in a much larger batch and realized it thickens nicely over the 30 minutes after adding the flour/cream combo so don't be too hasty - adding more flour destroys its creamy consistancy and takes out some of the flavor "", "" I was very pleased with this recipe! It came out thick creamy and tasty! I didn't have condensed chicken broth so I used 21 ounces of chicken broth (from a carton) and one cup of water. As it simmered away all day I had to add 1/4 cup of water a few times because the liquid got too low. Added the half and half and evap. milk and turned it up to high for the last 30 minutes. This thickened it up perfectly! I took some reviewers' advice and cooked the onions after the bacon. Saved some of the cooked bacon in the fridge for a garnish and I also snipped a bunch of fresh chives to put on top. Served with Fantastic Focaccia Bread from this site for dipping. Soooo good! A great comforting meal for a fall day! "", ' This tasted good but I was a little disappointed with the consistancy (only because I like potato soup to be thick).

I served it at a small dinner party, all my friends thought it was amazing. "", "" This was definitely a 10 in our family book! We're not coffee drinkers; it was mostly out of curiosity that I tried the recipe. I usually read all the reviews but didn't this time...I was just looking for a chuck roast recipe for which I had all the ingredients! Instead of using less coffee I used MORE because my coffee maker is 10 cups and I figured I'd just get a little more gravy. Reading the reviews later and hearing it was rather a strong coffee flavor it was a little scary since we don't drink coffee. I added 2 Lipton Onion Mushroom Soup Mix packets to balance out the coffee and some thick sliced potatoes and baby carrots to round out the dish. At the end the taste was DELLICIOUS! There was SO MUCH gravy however that after I removed the meat and vegetables thickened the gravy and added the sour cream I added some couscous to the gravy. I used 2 5.45 oz boxes (less the flavor packets of course) and while it was quite a bit thicker than we would have preferred it was absolutely wonderful! I think I'll make it again this weekend to take to my parent's home for Father's Day! Thanks for a winner Luella... "", ' Delicious. Very moist and flavorful. Followed suggestions on reducing amount of coffee to 4 cups and adding 2 cups of water. My husband and I really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe. ', "" Since so many reviewers said this recipe was bland I added 1t Durkee Steak Seasoning; 1/2t ea cajun seasoning &amp; rosemary; 1/4t ea thyme red pepper flakes &amp; cayenne; then 3/4c red wine &amp; 1/4c soy sauce in place of the 6th cup of coffee(almost all of the other reviewers' recommendations!). I simmered it for 2.5 hrs &amp; when I went to turn it over I tested it -- it was already past done &amp; getting dry so 5 hrs would have been way too long! No one else complained of this. We couldn't eat it the night I cooked it so I put the broth in the frig separate from the meat. The next day the grease was in a firm layer on the top so I separated it off. When I made the gravy I just used a small portion of the grease (one reviewer said this recipe was too greasy). For me the gravy was very tasty but much too concentrated. I think that next time I will follow JIHI's recommendation to put in 2c less coffee &amp; add 2c water. I rarely cook chuck roast because it is not a good cut &amp; I don't have luck cooking roasts. However in spite of it already being a little dry I must say the meat was wonderfully tender &amp; was excellent with the gravy. "", ' This was a pretty good recipe I added beef broth instead of the boullion cubes others had suggested and I used some rosemary thyme and a little oregano too (1 tsp ea) you don\'t have to like coffee to appreciate this recipe there is no ""coffee"" flavor I just think it makes the juices and gravy a little richer. ', "" I was also skeptical of the coffee addition. I loosely followed what kimshin2000 did-added water,soy sauce, thyme and oregano, as I did not have beef broth or any wine (terrible situation!) It reduced so nicely that I decided we really didn't need the calories of the sour cream-it thickened into a very rich, flavorful gravy. Thank you for the idea-I will be toying with this one again!!!!! "", "" Judging from the fact that when I got to the dish at pot luck it was empty I think this must have been a pretty good recipe. I'm glad I tasted it before I took it. It was great! Thanks. "", ' This recipe was wonderful! Very flavorful and easy! I followed the tips from the other reviewers and added beef broth red wine and less coffee (but very strong coffee) and loved it! ', ' This was the worst pot roast that I have ever tasted.. gravy wise. The meat was pretty much OK. I tried to correct it to no avail. It was bitter and just totally off.

', "" UPDATE 8/2008: This recipe is foolproof. I made this recently with a pregnant friend of mine and I left the recipe with her. I found out later she ate all of the pie and then made another one the next day! I too added some vanilla pudding mix and a bit of sugar to the whipped topping. Perfect. FANTASTIC! I also made a strawberry cream pie with this recipie subing banana pudding mix with strawberry glaze to taste. BOTH pies were HUGE hits! Handed them out to boyfriend's parents family friends and the rest was gobbled up by mom and pop! "", "" Best banana cream pie recipe ever. This was much better than anything store-bought and a hundred times better than anything from a cafeteria or buffet. The pies (I was able to make two with this recipe) were very rich and delicious yet not too sweet. I didn't have any crushed ice on hand but it made no difference as far as I could tell. Also the whipped cream topping tasted much better after adding some powdered sugar. It's not necessary to pipe on the topping as I just used a spatula. Everything tasted great together in Nilla pie crusts. After making one with peach on the bottom my advice is to stick with the bananas! "", "" So good! I made only one pie but mounded the filling up in the middle and I ended up putting it in a ready made shortbread crust. This is a wonderful desert to make if you don't want to spend much time on it no time at all to mix together. I will use my homemade regular pie crust next time and actually might not whip as long as I did because it was just a smidge too stiff. I would have liked it a touch creamier - still a great pie and much better then other versions I've tried. This would also make a great filling for a summer trifle recipe with various fruits or even switching the banana mix for chocolate for a chocolate cream pie. Options!! Thanks for the recipe. "", "" Fabulous pie! This was the first time I've made banana cream pie and it got rave reviews. I was told it was the best people have ever had. I followed others' suggestions and used 5-6 bananas banana cream pudding and added powdered sugar and vanilla to the topping. One thing I found with the crushed ice was to put it in a blender to totally crush it. This is definitely in my recipe box permanently! Thanks!! "", "" Awesome recipe and so easy to make. My family loves it. Instead of a baked pie shell I just buy a pre-made graham cracker shell. Also no need to use crushed ice. Just wet the inside of your mixing bowl and your metal mixers with water and then put them into the freezer for a few minutes. My family always does this when we make whipped cream. Also if the banana mixture gets too thick I just add some milk and stir to thin it out so it's nice and creamy. "", "" This was very easy and made enough to generously fill TWO ready-made graham cracker crusts (I used one graham one chocolate cookie crust). You do not need the ice in this recipe. In fact I used heavy whipping cream just brought from the store (so it wasn't even all THAT cold) and it worked just fine. The creamy consistency/texture of cream pies is what makes them great. I decided the chunkiness of so many bananas detracted from the creamy texture and the pie as a whole. I will not use as many bananas next time. What bananas I do use will be sliced razor thin. You don't really even need the whipped topping part - or you could put some on each slice when you serve it. This isn't the excellent banana cream pie you'd expect from a great sweet shop -- but it fits the bill in a pinch and you can make as many different flavored pies as they make instant puddings.

TIP--those who found it too soupy can add in several scoops of spicy refried beans (vegetarian) to help thicken it up--heat it for about 5 minutes after you add it and just before serving it to gauge how much you want.

Cover the stew while cooking on the stove and the pumpkin\'s top while in the oven. Also feel free to add nearly anything you like to the beef stew. I increased the vegetable count some. Just make sure that you do not add so much that the resulting stew no longer fits inside the pumpkin you have. About the pumpkin: I have no idea where you would find a 12 pound sugar pumpkin but it would not work. You need a standard ""jack-o-lantern"" pumpkin. A jack-o-lantern pumpkin contains quite a bit of water; making it unsuitable for use in most recipes. But the stew you create in the first part of this recipe is too thick on its own. However when you move it into the pumpkin to finish cooking the water from the pumpkin fixes that problem and adds a wonderful flavor as well.

It's a very rich soup and Half and Half cream seems to sustain the flavor while reducing the calories and fat content somewhat. "", "" A very delicous soup. Easy to follow instructions. It felt sinful to eat because of it's high fat content. A lower fat alternative I have tried to the bacon is smoked ham and milk instead of heavy cream. Sauteing the leeks is key to good flavor.

I am literally eating the soup as we speak and it is phenomenal. After reading other's reviews and seeing what I had on hand I used 5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 (5 cups of water seasoned with chicken buillion cubes); used half a pound of bacon and half a pound of cubed pancetta (I live in Italy now and we have to use what we can find!); sauteed 4 chopped garlic cloves with the 2 whole leeks; after the potatoes were tender I took out approximately 1/4 of the batch and mashed them easily by hand with a masher. This recipe is delicious. A good way to clean leeks for those of us who dont cook with them often is as follows: 1. Rinse the outsides cut off the bulb/root. 2. remove any outside leaves that are spotty or extra dark green trim the ends of the green top of the leek. 3. cut the leek lengthwise down the middle and chop according to recipe. 4. Place leeks in bowl of warm water and swirl around to remove excess dirt. 5. scoop out leeks and place in colandar rinse. It seems like alot of work but really its not that hard and it is worth it to not have dirt in your recipe. Thanks for the delicious soup - will most definitely make again! "", "" Seriously good soup!! I've made it lots of different ways and it always turns out perfect. I've substituted onions for leeks and ham for the bacon. I always use milk to make it more healthy. To make up for it, and to make the soup thicker, I stir in about 1/4 cup of potato flour - this makes it perfect - almost like a thick stew. I get compliments everytime I make this recipe - and that's quite often!! "", ' This recipe was good, but the directions were vague. I did not know what kind of potato to use, so I used large russett potatoes. I only needed 4. Also, the leeks were huge. I only needed one.

Personally I line a pan with foil, cut my pumpkin in half horizontally (whatever kind, I've used sugar pumpkins, pie pumpkins, and even some sort of fat mystery pumpkin), remove the insides, spray PAM on the foil, put the pumpkin cut-side down, and roast that baby for an hour or so.

I let the hot pumpkin rest about 15 minutes before I take a spoon and scoop out the flesh. I mash it while it's hot, but pureeing is probably even better - I just have never needed to. Your baking time will vary quite a bit based on the temperature of your pumpkin going in - if you were storing it on the porch then it's going to take longer because the pumpkin is colder :=) Thanks for the recipe!

No chocolate cake is ever complete without vanilla. Yes, the coffee (I use espresso) brings out the rich, deep flavor notes of the chocolate, but the vanilla highlights the ""flowery,"" sweet notes. To achieve the full depth and range of chocolate flavor, you need the vanilla. Then, when you smother this complex, delicious cake with a sweet frosting, you will have a truly complete chocolate experience. I chop this cake into serving-sized cubes and freeze them in squares of plastic wrap. Perfect treats at a moment\'s notice! Thank you for this recipe. ', "" Woohoo! This cake is the best and I never rate anything 5 stars! Even better than Hersheys' recipe. You can't taste the vinegar at all and a hint of coffee flavor will only show up depending on the frosting. Because I love chocolate so much I made a few adjustments; dusted the pan with cocoa powder instead of flour and added 1/4 c more cocoa to the recipe. Though I'm sure it would come out just as good as is! It was a snap to mix up in one bowl a snap to rinse off the bowl and utensils and a snap to bake (even though my stove has issues). I only had a glass pyrex dish and despite that it still came out moist. You know the kind of moist where if you touch the top some fine crumbs will sticks to your fingertip. Yummy. It was very much like Starbauchs black out cake if you have had it. Only without the ganache. I frosted it with Chocolate Cheese Frosting found here on Allrecipes by Carol. I will definately be using this recipe when I want a quick and fool proof moist cake. I had heard that the best chocolate cake recipes called for vinegar but this was the first that proved it. Thank you Kelly! "", "" I was looking for a devil's food cake recipe similar to the flavor of store bought cake mixes for ages. This one is it! It is better than the commercial mixes too as the cake does not fall apart getting it out of the pan. Also I was able to cut down the amount of sugar by half without any loss of flavor or texture. "", "" This is THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever tasted! Wow, and so easy. I didn't even have to get the mixer out; did fine by hand. As suggested by others, I replaced milk and vinegar with buttermilk. I used this recipe to make cupcakes, baked at 350 degrees for 24 minutes. Perfection. "", "" I have used this recipe for many cakes and have gotten rave reviews from everyone. I find it moist enough, chocolatey enough, everything enough. I haven't and won't change a thing. If it is worth 5 stars, it doesn't need changing. If it needs changing, it isn't worth 5 stars! "", "" This cake tasted just like a boxed cake mix. Boxed cake mix is good, but if I'm going to all the effort of making a cake from scratch I want it to taste better than the boxed stuff. I don't know why I choose to try this when I have previously used 2 amazing chocolate cake recipes (black magic cake and one bowl chocolate cake III from this site. From now on I'll stick to those). I did appriciate how easy this was to make though. ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22953

The buttercup used didn't have a high water content so added broth after everything else was pureed and added to the stockpot.

A couple key things for someone new to candy/fudge making: make sure you don't stir it AT ALL after it comes to a boil and until it's cooled off - take it off the heat and don't touch it. Otherwise, if you stir while it's boiling or while it's cooling off, you'll start the crystallization too early and it'll end up horribly grainy and even separate.

I then use a hand mixer and beat it on medium-high until it is creamy and really starting to thicken up (consistency pretty thick where you can see the tracks/ribbons from the mixer but still pourable - once at this point it'll firm up quick if you keep beating and you'll have to scrape it out of the pan).

Excellent flavor and creamy smooth texture. Will definately make this again. NOTE: regarding graininess..Any implement you put into the candy while cooking but remove and set aside has to be completely cleaned of any sugar from a previous dip into the boiling candy or it will cause the entire batch to start to crystalize and become grainy or sugary.

Omit the green onions and throw some minced garlic freshly ground black pepper and diced onion in with the ground beef. Stir the cheese mixture into the cooked noodles and place in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with the sauce. Cover and bake for 20 minutes uncover and top with the cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes more or until the cheese is bubbly. This makes a ton of seriously yummy comfort food. Everyone loves it! "", ' This is the only way I make spaghetti...ever! My favorite part is the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Update: I have made this many, many times and have finally perfected this wonderful recipe; I use 1.5 jars of sauce, I mix my cooked noodles with butter and lots of parmesan before putting in the pan, and finally I added about 1/2 cup of ricotta to the cream cheese/sour cream. ', "" Yummy, yummy, yummy! I buttered the spaghetti a bit before layering in the pan and I used a jar of Newman's Sausage and Peppers sauce along with 1/2 a jar of Ragu- it could have used more sauce so I would use two whole jars next time. I also combined some ricotta cheese with the cream cheese mixture. We all loved it! I might skip the cheddar cheese next time and replace it with mozzerella. You could also scale down the pasta a bit if you don't have a full pound and it would work fine...the pound of spaghetti really filled the pyrex. This will be something I make at least once a month- it makes a ton and I always appreciate left overs so I don't have to cook every day. Thanks for sharing a great pasta dish. "", "" I can't wait for lunch to have the leftovers!!! What a delicious hearty meal; so easy and so wonderful! I omitted both the green peppers and green onions and used Bertolli Organic Tomato Basil Sauce--YUM O! I sautéed half a sweet onion in butter until translucent in the same pan browned up quality lean ground beef seasoned to taste. Tossed thin spaghetti noodles w/ butter and parmesan cheese as suggested by Khristin (no dry noodles like others). Added 1/2 cup of low-fat ricotta cheese and substituted a combo of cheddar/jack and mozzarella for the cheddar cheese. After dinner I couldn t stop eating little bites from the casserole dish. Will be making this again soon! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!! "", "" Thank you for this recipe. I made it today for my husband who was coming home for a day from trucking. He raved and raved. But as usual I used it as a skeleton and changed the following... 1. I didn't measure out the sour cream and cream cheese exactly. I just blended a medium container of SC and 8 oz of CC. Much easier! 2. I used the 1 lb of spaghettie and added some broken pieces of lassagna I had. 3. I used 1 lb ground chuck AND 1 lb. roll of sage flavored sausage. I fried it together throwing in the green pepper and 4 cloves of garlic. I also used lots of spices to heat it up like cumin, oregano, garlic salt, seasoned pepper, pepper corn ? (like used at pizza hut to sprinkle on) and minced onion. 4. I bought 8 oz mozzarella and 8 oz sharp chedder and used all but 2 oz from each. It was delicious!! Since I baked it in a 14x11 pan, there were leftovers of the noodles and meatsauce. There was no extra sour adn cream cheese. I added the noodles to the sauce and froze for spaghetti later. I bagged and froze the leftover pie too. "", "" My husband and I are giving this 4 stars. It was amazing...but the noodles making up the bottom layer really dried up when it went into the oven. We followed the recipe to heart but for future attempts we suggest mixing the meat and noodles together so it dosen't dry up as bad adding the sour cream/chive/cream cheese on the top and then the cheese. We will do this again!! One of my personal favorites omitting the dry noodles. Thank you! Crystal T. "", "" This is a good recipe, but I tweak it a bit. I make my own sauce, and instead of spreading the cream cheese and sour cream over the spaghetti, I mix it in with the noodles. I've also found that mozzarella cheese is preferred by my family. But it's a good base recipe to work from. "", ' This was a really good recipe! I did tweak it just a little though. I mixed in some melted butter (about 1/4 cup) 1 egg and some paremesean cheese into the noodles before putting them in the pan. I also used the full 8oz pkg of cream chz instead of the 4oz it called for. I did not have any green onions so I mixed in some italian seasoning with my crm chz and sour cream. Sooooo good! My hubby &amp; kids raved about this one! ', ' This was tasty! And fairly easy too although there were more dishes to wash than I like. I omitted the green pepper (personal preference) reduced the spaghetti to approx. 3/4 lb and increased sauce by about another 1/4 jar. I like very saucy noodles and found that ratio to be perfect. I loved the sour cream and cream cheese. In the future I may take a few short cuts and use prepared meat sauce (rather than browning meat and simmering) and chive cream cheese (rather than cutting green onions). Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Aside from that, I made this exactly as written and it came out tender and soft with an amazing crumb texture. For anyone having trouble with the dough not rising, as per some other reviewers suggested, it might be a good idea to proof the yeast first. Also, make sure that the water you add is neither too hot, nor too cold, as both will affect whether or not the dough rises. If it's too cold, the yeast will not be activated, and if it's too hot, the yeast will be killed. A good temperature for bread recipes that call for warm water is somewhere between 110 and 115 degrees. A thermometer comes in real handy for this reason. One last suggestion is to make sure that any salt the recipe calls for does not come into direct contact with the yeast. Always add salt to the liquid ingredients first, and always add the yeast last. Once all of the ingredients are in my machine, I make a small well with a spoon on top of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast into that well. I hope these suggestions are helpful. "", "" This was my second time making this recipe. The first time was delicious but very small. The last time I made it it barely rose at all and was way too dense and rock hard on the outside.

"", ' This is a very good, simple recipe. I made a batch Saturday and they were gone before I knew it and on Sunday I had requests to make a 2nd batch. I followed the dough recipe exactly, but I did not use the fruit filling. I wrapped the dough around cocktail sausages and cheese. I found that sliced chz works better than grated. It melts better is much easier to work with. I wrapped a third of a chz slice around the suausge and then wraped dough around it. Make sure that you seal the dough well so that the chz does not melt out. I think next weekend I will make them with the fruit filling. ', ' These are a family favorite. I have made them MANY times. The key to consistency is to weigh the bread flour (and use King Arthur). By weight, use 1 pound 4 ounces of bread flour. Also, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup to match the sweetness of the traditional ones served in Texas. Lastly, to make sure your fruit filling does not spill over, press firmly to bottom of baking pan when making your indentions. By pressing the dough to the pan, it will prevent the middle from rising. Also, make sure you make an indention about 1 inch in diameter (i.e., several thumb prints). ', "" MMMM! I made these and the menfolk devoured them in a day and half. Used 1/2 can of cherry filling for the whole batch as I didn't want as much filling in the pastry. I used 2 T. cream cheese and 1 Tbsp. oil instead of extra egg yolk. Delicious! Drizzled with icing. Thankyou!!!!! "", ' Very good! All rave reviews from our house.

I just make sure the oil is at a temp that if you enter something, it sizzles. Never need a thermometer :) Mine are super puffy if I let one side cook for 2 min, flip ...then another 2 min. They taste exactly like they do at restaurants, and enough of a pocket inside to insert that warm honey. And why stick to squares? I found a star shape cookie cutter &amp; used them. Thought they were cuter. Don't overload your fryer though because you have to leave time to hurry &amp; flip. Also, be sure to wipe off extra oil w/ paper towels!!! Mine didn't taste greasy AT ALL doing it this way. :) "", "" I've been looking for a recipe this good for over five years, and this THE ONE. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon and the honey they recommend, and serve with a scoop of Breyer's vanilla ice cream. It's truly the best. "", ' This recipe is wonderful!! Light and tender... crispy and easy to cook all the way through. I worked in a Mexican restaurant for a bit and we used to take the balls of fresh tortilla dough and just lightly spread/pull them to the right thickness &amp; round shape in front of the fryer. Instead of rolling &amp; messing up my counter, I let the dough rest 20 min.... rolled it into 2"" balls &amp; then let them rest about 10 min. &amp; pulled them like I used to. They turned out better than the restaurant\'s! The last few had an extra 15 min rest and they were even better. This will be my only sopapilla recipe &amp; I\'m using it for fresh tortillas too! Thank you for the recipe!! **UPDATE** I stuck several leftover balls of dough in the freezer..just to see what happens. A few days later... HOLY COW! They rose as they defrosted, and, when fried they were soo puffy that they were almost round &amp; completely hollow. I noticed a little bit of a crust on the raw dough just from air contact, but it was completely undetectable after fried. How dangerous can it get with amazing sopapillas just minutes away with virtually no prep??? Thanks again.....I think :o) ', "" I'm Hispanic, and this is a regular dessert at my house. One thing I learned from my my mother was not to roll out the whole dough. Make small meatball size portions and roll out one at the time. They come out thin, puffy, and very crispy.

', "" just like my abuela's "", "" PUFFING YOUR SOPAPILLA: I realize this is somewhat an issue commonly discussed so I shall tell you all what needs to happen in order to puff your sopapillas. When you drop the dough into your oil you should then proceed to spoon oil over the dough. Yes, begin this immediately. Once the sopapilla is puffed be sure to remember and flip it so that it browns evenly on both sides. Don't forget that the dough needs to not be a thick piece, as a sopapilla should be hollow on the inside. This will happen if you use thin pieces of dough. I hope this helps everyone. Good luck!

I also topped with some grated romano cheese and shredded mozzarella the last 10 mins of baking. I will definitely be making these again.

I would let it set for about 3 minutes before pouring into jars just because my first poured jar had the banana and jelly part seperate a bit but all the rest were perfect so I'm thinking the pectin just needs a moment to set before you begin pouring.

Remove and place on towel to dry. The lids will suction down while cooling. "", "" I make lots of different fruit jams this is a nice addition as it uses different fruit. We like the fruit taste without the pectin. Skip the water. General rule is one cup sugar to one cup fruit adjust based on if fruit is sweat or tart. Chop up the cranberries before you measure them this gives a better measurement and you don't have whole cerrberryy skins.. I had 3 cups of berries so used 4 cups of sugar figured the bananas did not need much sugar. Cook the cranberries with just the sugar ( it will liook dry but as soon it starts heating there will be plenty of juice). Add a pat of butter and turn the heat down to prevent foam.

I found it to be a bit too sweet so I may cut the sugar next time. Also I didn't taste banana at all. I thought this jam tasted more like strawberry than cranberry - maybe because it's so sweet? Also after the initial 10 simmer of the cranberries they were still mostly whole so I mashed them up with a spoon. Maybe that's the difference? Possibly if I had left them whole I would have gotten a more tart taste and would have been able to distinguish between the banana and the cranberry.

No this should be a quick dish (once you have the ingredients) and I certainly have never fried the meat first. One person altered the recipe so much that it could not bear much resemlance to the original! I understand about the milk allergy but why leave out the breadcrumbs? It improves the texture.

I never heard of Bobotie until I saw this recipe and the mix of ingredients intrigued me so I took the plunge. It smells wonderful when baking. The first bite was a little strange but as I continued to eat it the taste began to grow on me and I can honestly say I liked it. (My husband thought it was only okay).

This is ridiculous. The buttermilk pie was runny because they didn't incorporate the ingredients properly. This pie has a lot of liquid, so you have to be careful. Buttermilk pie looks easy, but that's because the ingredients are so simple. It takes technique to combine. Start with room temp. ingredients, and make it easy on yourself and do the first 3 ingredients first and blend well. I melted my butter instead of softening it and it came together much better. When adding the eggs, do one at a time and make sure its incorporated well before adding the next. Then the buttermilk and vanilla. Overall, not a bad recipe for buttermilk pie on this site. It is one of the best out of the 5 others I've made and reviewed on this AR. The baking time should be tweaked, as with all custard pies you can partially blind bake the pie shell, or bake it on the lowest rack for 400 for 10-15 min to set the crust and then lower to the posted temp. until it's set. This easily prevents soggy bottom crust. Buttermilk pie is done when it doesn't jiggle. Don't overbake the pie. It's not supposed to be dark brown on top. Who likes dark brown scrambled eggs? Ew. "", ' I uppped the flour in this recipe from 3 Tbls to a little more than one cup. I did this because I had made the buttermilk IV recipe and it was way too custardy and runny. I was trying to find a recipe that was more of a spongy kind of pie, from a recipe that I loved at a Utah restaurant. Anyway, upping the flour turned this cake into a recipe of its own, so maybe I will post it seperate. ', "" Wow! This is like creme brulee pie! I followed directions exactly except I used a deep dish pie crust and increased cooking time to 70 min. Make sure you wrap the crust edge with foil so it doesn't burn. After you take the first piece soak up syrup in pan with a paper towel and there should be no more seeping. I found this to be spectacular after being refrigerated for a few hours. The best pie I have ever tried! "", "" This pie is deeelish! I've made some minor adjustments. I only used 1 cup of sugar and used 5 tablespoons of butter. I also didn't use a pie crust and it turns out beautiful. I added some whipped cream and blackberries. Thanks for great recipe! "", "" This pie is really good! I made several during the Holiday season and they really went over well! I have never made one of these before so I don't know if this is normal but after you cut a piece of pie a clear liquid drains into the empty spot eventually. So I started putting a piece of a paper towel there to absorb it. The pie is delicious. Use a deep dish crust. "", "" First of all, this recipe is silly easy to make. I had been trying to make a buttermilk pie on and off for literally six years. I would follow the recipe strictly, but the pie would always come out too runny, no matter how long I cooked it. Finally, one of the reviewers on here pointed out that they accidentally misread the ingredients, and the pie came out great. Then another reviewer wrote that she deliberately altered the recipe in one key way to make it less runny. What I did was follow the recipe included except for three things: I used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of 3 teaspoons; I used 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, and I also added maybe 0.75 tablespoons of cornstarch to the buttermilk I had, since it was 1% fat buttermilk, and I wasn't sure whether all buttermilk was supposed to be that low fat (this was also suggested by one reviewer). I ended up baking the dish for around 60 minutes or so, and the center came out perfectly no runniness at all, even after cutting out one of the pieces. Good pie, and it takes about 15 minutes to put together, especially when you use a store bought pre made crust like I did. Try it! "", ' I cooked this for an hour and a half and it was so runny inside when i tried to take a piece out it was like soup. ', "" I had leftover buttermilk from an Irish soda bread for St. Patrick's Day and searched for buttermilk recipes. TGhis was my first introducation to buttermilk pie. Great recipe. I also made my first successfull pie crust and the filling fit perfectly. I followed the temp and cooking time and it was golden brown with a thin sweet and crisp top to the pie. I did use lowfat buttermilk so I dissolved 1 tsp. of cornstarch in the buttermilk before adding it. I really want to try it with egg beaters and margarine but I'm sure it won't be the same. My husband LOVES LOVES LOVES this recipe just as it is. Thanks for sharing! "", "" Absolutly the BEST buttermilk pie! I was a bad girl!:-) I didn't tell my children what was in the pie. THEY LOVED IT! Now at my house it is called Custard Pie. They will NEVER know.:-)))) ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23131

Like other reviewers I made changes based on the unavailablity of lady fingers in my area and with the filling amount and process. I used one store bought angel food cake in place of the lady fingers. I also used a 9X13 pan. Here are the amounts of other ingredients I used: 5 egg yolks 1/3 cup white sugar 3 Tbsp vanilla extract 16 oz Marscarpone cheese 1 angel food cake 1 cup strongly brewed instant coffee 1.5 Tbsp cocoa powder I placed slices of angel food cake in the pan then spooned 2 teaspoons of coffee per piece over the bottom layer rather than dipping. Then I put a layer of filling and then a layer of cake this time with 3 teaspoons per piece. It worked out wonderfully and was not soggy at all. As a former health inspector I was concerned about using raw eggs but there's enough sugar in the mix to not allow bacterial growth. I also made sure to promptly refrigerate any remaining cake. I especially love this recipe because I wanted tiramisu without the alcohol. I will definetly make this again. I may substitute the marscarpone with neufchatel cheese as I wouldn't mind it tasting a bit like cheesecake and it would make it less expensive. "", ' This is one of the most delicious no bake easy recipes there are. The only reason I had to give it 4 stars is because I had to make a few changes to make it even better-1st change is double the filling amount. 2nd change is to dip the ladyfingers (make sure they are not soft but hard cookie ones) in a mixture that is 2 parts coffee 1 part frangelico hazelnut liquor. Then i added some whipped cream on top. This is excellent and everyone that tries it loves it. ', "" I had a few issues with this recipe. First of all I did follow others suggestions and made twice the cheese filling. The filling was very thin even after adding an additional 1/4 cup of cheese. After sitting in the fridge for 24 hours it did finally firm up enough to where you could cut into it and have a formed piece instead of the filling running everywhere. Second if you are going to use an 8x8 pan as the recipe calls for you should not need all 24 lady fingers or to double the filling. My 8x8 pan would hold 12 lady fingers and the orginal quantity of filling. Thinking in advance I did a dry run with the cookies by placing them in the 8x8 pan before I even started the rest of the recipe. I ended up using an 11x7 pan and I thought it was the perfect size. Because the filling was so thin the cheese mixture didn't do a very goo job of actualy forming a seperate layer. Overall the taste was fine but if I make another tiramisu I will try another recipe. "", ' For never making Tiramisu before this recipe helped me look like a pro. A co-worker born in Italy (and a Tiramisu fanatic) raved on and on about it what more can I say but thanks:) ', "" This is a FABULOUS recipe and so easy! It turned out perfect for me but I took the advice of others so it wouldn't turn out runny. Only dip the lady fingers in the coffee for 1 second per side. That is plenty any longer and it will turn to complete mush. I know some people suggested using a pastry brush but that doesn't add enough coffee. I also let it sit overnight as so many said it tasted better the next day. It was a complete hit and everyone is asking for the recipe. Very Yummy!!! "", ' I made this recipe before and it turned out excellent. However when I did it this time it turned out to be very soggy to the point that I have liquid sipping out in the pan soaking the leftovers. It happened twice this past 2 weeks and I could not understand what happened. Also the recipe did not mentioned anything about the eggwhite but I went ahead and beat eggwhites to stiff peak with 1 teaspoon of sugar and then fold into the cheese mixture. That should not have affected the result..... ', "" This was a great recipe! I couldn't find any lady fingers so I substituted sugar free pepridge farm milano cookies (since my stepdad is diabetic). I also replaced the white sugar with a sugar substitute. And then I couldn't find mascarpone cheese so I used the recipe using cream cheese (it's called 'mascarpone substitute' here I believe). anyways although mine was a little cheesecake like it was still delicious even as a diabetic recipe... except I did use regular whipped cream.

You don't directly put the masa harina powder/water mixture in the soup do you? Thanks for any help! "", "" Yummy. I think it is close to Chili's C. E. soup. I heated a tbsp olive oil and added 2 cloves of garlic and then added 3 small chicken breasts. I cooked the breasts in a pot on both sides until juices were clear. Then I removed the chicken and added the diced onions and cooked until translucent. I poured in 2 (14.5 oz each)cans of chicken broth and stirred. I mixed 1/4 cup of masa harina which is corn flour (Quaker company makes this also found on the aisle where the Latino food products are or near the regular white flour)with a 1/2 cup of water stir it well to get out lumps and then I added it to the pot that has the chicken broth and onions. Then I mix another 1/4 cup of masa harina with just enough water to make it like a thick wet paste stir it until blended it should not look dry or crumbly but smooth and sort of thick. I added this mixture to the pot and stirred.

Brought to a boil stirring often so the cheese did not stick as much and also used a non-stick pot. Added diced cooked chicken. Stirred. Reduce heat and I simmer until thick about 5 minutes. This gives the soup a thick/thin top texture not as grainy from the masa harina. I topped it with pico de gallo and crushed tortilla chips (Tia Rosa Mega thins) and a little shredded cheese. Excellente!! "", ' I used this as a basic recipe, but then also added ingredients listed in the Chicken Tortilla Soup I (by Star Pooley), also on this website. Revisions using THIS recipe included: using one whole large chopped onion (rather than 1/2), 3 garlic cloves (rather than 1), did not add the 3rd cup of water, used green enchilada sauce, used real jack cheese (rather than processed ""cheese"" and used it as a garnish only), did not add salt. I also cut the chicken breasts up into bite-sized pieces and put them in one of those basket-vegetable steamers rather than cooking in oil. From the OTHER Tortilla Soup recipe, I also added 1/4 tsp oregano, 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes, 1 c corn, 1 c white hominy, 1 can chopped green chilis, and 1 can black beans.

The masa harina adds a wonderful texture. I omitted the processed cheese and sprinkled a teaspoon of Pepper Jack cheese on each bowl. ', "" I have been making this recipe for years. Nearly everyone I give it to loves it. I sometimes use instant corn meal in place of the masa harina. I wouldn't recommend the corn starch that another reviewer used- this recipe gets so much of its character from the masa harina that won't shine through with corn starch. I like to use a small can of mexican style tomato sauce because it gives the same flavor but is less expensive than enchilada sauce. This soup definitely gets much thicker the second or third day so you may need to add water and if keeping it on a simmer make sure to stir often or you will have burnt cheese. (Even then it's pretty good!!!) "", "" What a great soup! I boiled the chicken first and left out the oil and also the salt (I like alot of salt but the cheese has plenty in it). I did find that I had to stir it constantly to keep it from scorching. I couldn't find anything labeled 'masa harina' so I asked at the grocery store and was directed to 'instant corn masa mix'. It worked great! Very tasty! Economical too! "", ' A potluck favorite at work. I shred up a pre-roasted chicken and cut everything else up the night before.

"", "" First time I've ever made a turkey in a bag and it was very moist and flavorful and browned beautifully. I cooked a 13 lb bird at 350 degrees and it took 2-1/2 hours. I cut a large onion in quarters and a bulb of garlic in half and stuck it in the turkey cavity as well as seasoning the cavity with salt &amp; pepper. You don't need to even peel the onion or garlic - just cut it and put it in the cavity. This will give the drippings a great flavor and help infuse your bird with flavor. I also carefully lifted the skin from the breast and liberally massaged the raw breast with a mixture of softened butter with some garlic powder, dried parsley, &amp; rubbed sage. I then rubbed the same mixture over the entire bird before I bagged it and sprinkled with coarse sea salt. Rubbing butter over the breast will help keep the breast meat moist and flavorful. You can use just butter or any combination of seasoning you like added in. Just be careful not to tear the skin. I also let it rest about 20 minutes or so in the bag after I took it out of the oven. I plan on using this bagged method in the future because it really did help keep the bird moist and no basting! "", ' I have tried this recipe and it really works!!

I substituted 1/2C Brandy for the wine and used 3/4C beef broth with the tomato sauce, it was awesome. Whenever I cook stews or something similar to this in the slow cooker, too much liquid can be a problem. My secret is adding 1 good Tablespoon of Tapioca about an hour before it's done. Leave the cover off and let it thicken. It does not cloud the sauce and keeps it very smooth. It keeps it more of a sauce than a gravy.You can always put the lid back on to perfect the amount of thickening you want. I served it with Garden Harvest Rice pilaf and salad.

Because several reviewers had suggested that the sauce was too thin, I did make an oilflour roux, but turned out I did not need it. I used about 20 oz. canned diced tomatoes (again as a result of other reviewers\' suggestions) and only about 12 cup wine. I did use a small 6oz. can of tomato paste, but next time, I would only use half, as it had just a bit too strong a tomato flavour. I also added Italian Seasoning and Oregano.

The candy will puff up and fill the entire pan. It is a good idea to use a metal pan or one of those flexible pans. This makes it easier to get the candy out when it cools.

My brother and I used to fight over the angel food candy every Christmas. It was a favorite of both of ours. After I made this, I couldn't wait for him to try some. Well, as I thought, he couldn't keep his hands off of it. When I told him that I made it, he wouldn't believe me. I actually had to show him the recipe in order to convince him that it wasn't store bought. Here are a few things that you might like to know about this recipe.

Thanks Debbie, for sharing this recipe with us. "", ' Perfect! It is also called fairy food, seafoam, sponge candy, honeycomb, hot air candy, etc. After 8-10 failed batches, I finally found the way to success: If you don’t have a high quality DIGITAL candy thermometer, don’t even try this. The brand I use is CDN. Previously I had tried a cheap analog thermometer and/or testing in cold water, but the candy cooks so quickly that by the time the thermometer registered the right temp (or a sample formed a brittle thread), the candy had already cooked to a much higher temp. It burned EVERY time I tried these methods. Before starting to cook the candy, prepare: Line your pan with non-stick foil. Measure and sift baking soda. Make sure your pan is large enough, as the mixture will foam a great deal after you add the baking soda. Use a heat-proof silicone spatula for stirring the candy mixture. Cook only at medium heat or lower; higher will cause the candy to cook too fast and it will burn. Be ready; the SECOND the candy thermometer registers 295° (300° risks burning), slide your pan off the burner and add the baking soda. Stir quickly, but be sure to incorporate every bit of the soda. (It’s nasty to get even a teeny bite of pure soda!) Pour into the nonstick foil-lined pan as evenly as you can, but resist the urge to spread it. It will fill in the empty spots as it cools and settles. Score cooled candy w/ a serrated knife, then place into a Ziploc bag and break. Pieces will be irregular in shape. ', "" Yes - finally SUCCESS!! I've been making this candy using this recipe for 4 or 5 yr now. Best candy ever but frustrating to make. We make for Christmas, but it takes 4 - 5 tries to get 2 - 3 good batches. Well, this year I went back and read all the reviews and made some changes and ended up with 2 perfect batches for 2 tries!! Per Lisa K, we sifted the baking soda, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (in place of 1 cup white), used parchment paper to line the pan, put in 225 degree oven for 10 min after we poured into pan, then lowered to 170 for 10 min more (amazed it continues used to puff up), and lastly scored with a knife and then broke by hand into (mostly) perfect pieces (did try the pizza cutter but got very crumbly results. Thought I would put all these tips in one place. I'm so excited I don't have to go through numerous ruined batches to get the couple of good ones I need for the holidays. This truly is a family favorite and want to thank everyone for the great tips! "", ' This is great! I have tried a lot of different reipes and this one is a good one. For the person who said it smells like campfire marshmallows burning; you are probably cooking it on too high heat. I used to burn mine all the time because I was in a hurry to get it up to the required temperature on the candy thermometer. I have learned to cook it slower and it turns out every time. I also use light corn syrup and it tastes good. ', ' Wonderful recipe brought me back to my favorite childhood treat. BUT much better with real dipping chocolate than the coating. ', ' Very quick and easy to make. Tastes just like the old fashioned Angel Food Candy my husband grew up eating at Christmas time he said. I used real chocolate (3 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips) and 1/4 cup of vegetable shortening to make my own chocolate coating (heated it in microwave). Then set the candy in the refrigerator to set up faster. ', ' This is a really easy recipe. For one who had never made candy or used a candy thermometer until this recipe I found it very easy. I would also like to stress not to spread the candy once you have placed it in the pan. Makes more than it seems like it is going to. ', "" The only issue I had with this recipe wasn't really with the recipe. You should note REMOVE IMMEDIATELY from heat when the desired temp is reached...otherwise it tastes a little burned. "", "" OK, you're all probably going to hate me. I had NO trouble making this recipe at all. And I've never made it before. So, you CAN do it. Don't be afraid to try! But, I did read the reviews thoroughly. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and sifted my baking soda. I greased my GLASS (Bc it's what I have) baking pan well, over every crevice, and had everything all ready to go and in it's place when I started cooking the candy. You want to cook it LOW &amp; SLOW. I'm talking med low heat, it will take a LONG time. Find something else to do while it's cooking., and leave it alone! I used only a cheap candy thermometer because it's what I had, and I found that my candy was ready before it reached 350 degrees. I used the cold water test. That's a better indicator of when it's ready then strictly going by the temp (again,in my opinion. I mean, what did our moms and grandmother's do without candy thermometers?). Also, I too used melted semi-sweet chocolate with just a touch of shortening in it in place of the choc conf coating. "", "" I don't know how it was supposed to turn out, exactly, but it wasn't what I had envisioned.

I served this cold at a dinner for 20 and got loads of compliments. Adding 15% more chocolate made the flavor intense. I would add a few steps to the instructions. 1)Destroy every lump in the powder mix or risk lumpy pudding. 2)Grate the chocolate. It melted at the same moment the mixture boiled. 3) Stir a few spoonfuls of heated cream/chocolate mixture into the egg yolks to warm them up BEFORE putting the egg yolks into the pot. ', "" Very creamy and tasty. Unsweetened cocoa powder (with a little vegetable oil) can be substituted for the unsweetened chocolate with good results. As an aside, for those having trouble adding in the egg: beat the yolks in a bowl and add a tiny bit of the hot pudding in, mix it up and add a little more. Then you can add the yolks into the pudding and they won't 'scramble'. Seperate the yolks carefully as well or you'll get bits of cooked egg white in your pudding. Overall a good, old-fashioned pudding recipe with wonderful texture and flavour. "", "" Basically this is a wonderful, old-fashioned pudding recipe that's been around for decades. In this recipe an extra teaspoon of vanilla is used. However, the cooking method here is asking for trouble - like cooked bits of eggs to be specific! (If that happens you might still be able to salvage it by sieving it) Do NOT stir the egg yolks into the hot mixture! Rather, stir about a half cup of the hot mixture into the yolks to temper them, then return the egg mixture to the saucepan to finish cooking. Finally, whether you leave this in one serving bowl or pour into individual serving dishes, cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Note: For a vanilla variation eliminate the chocolate and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. "", "" This pudding is delicious! My kids and I had this as a snack with some vanilla wafers and loved it! I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe though- I cut the vanilla extract down to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract as well. I also omitted the butter at the end (simply because I got busy with my kids and forgot until it was already in the fridge) and even without it this was the richest creamiest pudding I've ever made and I saved on some calories and fat! I will definitely make this again! "", "" I thought this recipe was great simply because it is so easy to make! I will use it again with a couple of slight variations. I thought it was a bit too sweet and the sweetness overpowered the more complex deep chocolate flavor that I was really hoping for. Next time I will use 3/4 cup sugar. Also I used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and I found that I was left with little dark flecks of chocolate throughout the pudding that hadn't melted completely despite the fact that I cooked at a lower heat for a longer period of time to try to avoid this. I don't think this had any impact on the flavor because the pieces were so tiny but next time I will melt the chocolate before adding it in. The little chocolatey spots definitely show that the pudding is homemade though so if they don't bother you just follow the recipe as is and go for it! Although the recipe doesn't mention it make sure you temper your egg yolks before adding them in. (Add a little of the chocolate mixture to the yolks first and whisk to bring up the temperature then pour in to the main mixture and whisk.) Failing to do this will leave you with little chocolatey scrambled eggs! Also I would suggest using a whisk for the entire cooking process to ensure a lump-free pudding. All in all very tasty! "", ' I upped the chocolate to 2.5 ounces and told my dad that it was really rich...""Well who doesn\'t want rich pudding?"" This was really good though. Very creamy rich and chocolately. I only used maybe a teaspoon of butter and it still had great flavor. The best chocolate pudding recipe so far. ', "" This was exactly what I was looking for. I did grate the chocolate which worked out very well. Definitely temper the egg yolks by stirring some hot mixture into them then adding them to the pan. If you skip this step you'll wind up with little chunks of scrambled egg yolk in your pudding. "", ' There\'s a trick to get all of the chocolate to melt. Use a whisk!! This recipe turns out great!

And I didn't have any chocolate sauce so I took milk chocolate chips which I used for the base also and melted them in the microwave with some butter about a tablespoon or two to a half cup or you could use regular oil kind of like you do when making a coating to dip truffles in.

For those of you who may not know the difference, ""country style ribs"" refers to the cut of meat not the manner of preparation. There are three types of ""ribs"". Spare ribs which come from the belly, baby back which come from the loin, and country style which are no actually ribs and are cut from the blade end of the loin. Country style ribs have by far and away much more meat and very little if any bone. And it is precisely the extra marbling and meat that allows them to cook so long. If you tried this and the meat was too dry, you probably used the wrong cut. If you are dead certain you used the proper cut, you might try a simple light to moderate brining solution for 12-24 hrs. But I\'ve never had this method let me down. And don\'t reserve this for BBQ. Use it with any sauce you like... cranberry, marinaded asian, etc...

My local store had the country style pork ribs on sale, so I stocked up my freezer, and boy am I glad I did now that I have this great recipe!!! My husband absolutely loved them as well! Instead of just the ribs with BBQ sauce poured over them (which isn't a bad thing!), the tender meat had this subtle taste of garlic and lemon going all through it! I used a large non-stick roasting pan, so that each rib wasn't touching. I rubbed them generously with kosher salt and minced garlic (from the jar, gotta love convenience) all over. I ended up using about 3 or 4 lemons, and layed lemon slices so that they covered the ribs completely.

I had 2 pans so I cooked them at 325 for 2 hours covered with aluminum foil. After 2 hours I drained the juice and covered the ribs with BBQ sauce. I turned the temp down to 275 and left the foil on for another 30 minutes. I then removed the foil for 20 minutes to let the sauce thicken. So a total of 2 hours and 50 minutes. The ribs fell off the bone! I also used tenderizer, minced garlic, fresh lemon (which I squeezed over the ribs) and sliced onions. Oh, I did not add water. If you use the right ribs and keep them covered, you should not have a problem with dry ribs. The amount of juice that I had to drain was more than plenty to make a gravy.

I did not have lemon - so I just sprinkled ribs (liberally) with garlic salt, and baked in a shallow baking pan (uncovered) for 2 full hours at 250 degrees. I drained the juice off, added the bbq sauce, and continued cooking for another full hour. The meat was delicious and VERY tender. Really good recipe! ', "" My family is CRAZY about these ribs. I've made it three times now and suggest you bake an hour longer at 250, remove the lemon slices and then bake for the final hour w/bbq sauce. Perfection! They were then fall-off-the bone tender! "", "" I did these in the crock pot adding a 1/2 can of diet coke with lemon. I KNOW, it sounds odd, but EVERY time I add a coke to meat, no matter what the cut, it turns out tender. And for as cheap as these ribs were (got em' on sale) they turned out sooooooo good. I put them on high in the crock pot (I have a 5 quart) at 2 p.m. and they were falling off of the bone by 6 p.m. (my crock pot cooks faster for an unknown reason). Thanks Glenda, I will pick up this cut a little more often! :) "", "" I thought this recipe was excellent. I seasoned my ribs with garlic powder and salt &amp; pepper first.

The recipe doesn’t tell you this, but after you add the flour and vanilla, you need to cook for about another 10 minutes or so low temp to thicken this into a sauce, otherwise you’ll have something that is the consistency of milk. I ended up adding more flour to thicken it a bit. Also, take a few spoonfuls of the sauce and put it in a small bowl before you add the flour/vanilla. Add the flour/vanilla, stir it well, and then add back to the sauce, Otherwise if you add the flour directly to the hot milk-sugar-egg mixture without tempering it, you’ll end up with lumpy sauce.

I also boil a whole chicken with onion, salt and celery the night before, strain out the chunks, refrigerate broth, skim off fat next day, and use instead of canned broth (but breasts and canned broth works okay, too, just not as flavorful – I cut cooking time by microwaving the breasts in the canned broth instead of baking in oven, then strain broth before adding to pot). I use a large can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the homemade taco seasoning that was given in another review, and a cup of mild picante sauce. I crush Multi-Grain Toastitos and add with a dollop of fat-free sour cream and the avocado when serving. Fruit salad on lettuce leaves rounds it all out. Simply divine.

It sets up quick and you don't need the fridge. Make sure when you bring it to the boil stage bring it to 225 degrees, then the fudge always hardens. "", ' I may have stumbled upon the problem some people are having with this recipe. It\'s the amount of evaporated milk. When a recipe says ""one can"" I usually just go with what seems to me to be a standard sized can. But before I poured it in the saucepan this time, I checked the ounces. Whaddya know? To me, a can of evaporated milk is 12 ounces. But this recipe only calls for a 5 ounce can. So be sure to check the size of your milk can! I personally LOVE the fudge you make from the recipe on the back of the marshmallow cream jars. But the cream contains eggs and my son is allergic. (Marshmallows themselves usually do not -- weird, huh?) Anyway, this reciped turned out better than any other non-marshmallow cream variety I\'ve tried. It\'s creamy, sets up well and tastes nice and yummy. (With all that butter and sugar it ought to!) A quibble is that to my eye it never really lost its gloss. But I quit beating after several minutes anyway and it turned out fine. No nuts for us due to allergy issues as well -- that can be a problem with some fudge recipes I\'ve tried but not this one! Try this an be diligent about the milk measurement and you\'ll be pleased. And of course, as with anything with milk and this much sugar, forget the directions to stir ""frequently"" during the heat-up stage and just plan on stirring constantly. ', ' So yummy! We ate way too much of this! Use a bigger saucepan than you think you\'ll need, because it just about doubles in size as it cooks and you don\'t want any boil-over accidents. I lined my pan with foil too so I can just lift the whole thing up, peel the foil off and cut it up on a cutting board. When it says to beat until it ""loses its gloss"" I thought I hadn\'t done it long enough (it was still a little glossy), but it set up perfectly. I love the crunch walnuts add to this. ******UPDATE: Made this again 12/20/5 with orange extract instead of vanilla, kept everything else the same. It was SO GOOD! Try it this way, or use your favorite flavor. (Kept the amount of extract the same, using ""real"", not artificial, orange flavoring).

After I poured it into two pans I topped one pan with crushed candy canes and the other with walnut halves. Both versions went over really well but people seemed to really like the one with the candy cane on top. Very festive looking too. The only suggestion I have is to give a approximate time needed to beat the mixture.

I took the advice of another reviewer and increased the sugar by an additional 1/2 cup, and, I used 50% brown sugar and 50% white (so 1 and 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 and 1/4 cup brown sugar). Just gives more flavor that way. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and about two teaspoons of cinnamon. I mixed the eggs together then tossed in the sugars, vanilla &amp; sour cream all at once. Used three cups of blueberries and fat free Breakstone's Sour Cream. I used a modified crumb topping recipe from a Barefoot Contessa sour cream coffee cake recipe to top muffins: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup all purpose flour, 6 tablespoons cold butter cut into pieces, two tsps cinnamon. Pinch mixture together with your fingers for couple minutes until it forms more of a crumble). First time I made this topping I worried it was too loose, but it holds well. just spoon a good heaping TBSP on top of each muffin before cooking. They come out SO moist and flavorful. Wouldn't dream of making them without a crumb topping. Another Barefoot hint: use a regular ice cream scoop (the old fashioned half ball shaped kind with the release lever in the scoop) and scoop evened off scoops of batter into the cups -- they make the perfect size muffin every time. My tip: used a KitchenAid silicone muffin pan &amp; it worked like a charm. This recipe made two dozen large muffins. These will have people thinking you're a pro in the kitchen. "", ' I tried a healthier version (6% fat vs. 45% fat) of this recipe and it turned out great. I substituted apple sauce for the oil and low-fat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream. I used 2 cups of whole-wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour and added an extra cup of blueberries. I also saved 1/2 a cup of sugar (and only mixed 1 1/2 cups into the eggs) and used it to top the muffins prior to baking but I found this was too much sugar, 1/4 cup would have worked much better.

There is no need to tweak or tinker with this recipe at all--as the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is a perfect, plump and pretty muffin, moist, pleasantly sweet and cakey, just bursting with blueberry flavor.

I am a professional baker and I made this recipe exactly as it said and it turned out great. I think the other reviewers who did not rate this recipe well did not follow the recipe and mix the ingredients properly. It's a good recipe! "", "" All in all, a very good recepie! Muffins came out absolutely delicious... I did a bit of tinkering with it, heeding the advice of previous reviewers. Changes I made were as follows: 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar, 1 TBSP of Vanilla instead of 1 tsp, added 2 tsps of cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, used 1 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup plain yogurt. (That last one because it turned out that I didn't have enough sour cream.) And wound up adding 2 lbs of frozen blueberries instead of two cups. (16 oz weight isn't the same as 16 oz liquid, I know this, yet I forget...) This recepie is really very forgiving. I keep reading that some people complain about them being flat and heavy, and my only guess is that they are possibly overmixing the batter. Much like pancake batter, it's important to mix only until ingredients are just incorporated. Don't be afraid to stir it, but don't go at it like it's a cake batter, either. "", "" My search for the perfect blueberry muffin is over! These are just like something out of a bakery. Not only are they moist and flavorful, but actually come out of the oven looking pretty. I cut the recipe in half for a dozen and used only 1/4 c. of oil and used a full tsp. of vanilla. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! These were done in exactly 20 mintues.

Now I wished I hadn't as I will have to make more! Everyone loved them-thanks! UPDATE 2012: I use melted butter rather than oil - the flavor is much better. A streusel type topping is very good on these, but you don't need it. People still tell me how good these are, and they ARE good! "", ' These muffins are the best! Mind you I altered it quite a bit but that was only because I am trying to incorporate healthier choices into my diet. First I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of unbleached flour. Second I added 1 cup of ground flax seed and reduced the amount of oil (I used grapeseed oil) to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple juice as well as substituted 1 cup of sucanat (organic evaporated cane juice) and combined these with my frozen blueberries as suggested by a previous review and 1 cup of organic sugar. Last but not least I used homemade non-fat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. Although it seems that I did not use this recipe at all it was a base for me and I just used the ingredients that I want myself and my family to consume.

Great recipe and I was glad that I was able to make them healthier by oven frying them. I will definitely make them again. ', ' These are soooo good! I had a chicken wing night in which I prepared these, the Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings, and the Honey Lime Chicken Wings. They all were great, but these Japanese Chicken Wings were our favorite. So sweet, so flavorful, so crispy, so moist! One word of caution... line your roasting/baking pan with sturdy aluminum foil. The sugar/vinegar sauce gets very gooey near the end of the baking portion of the recipe and can be tough to clean up. ', "" I did not fry my wings. I baked the wings with a little seasoning salt on both sides for about 30 to 45 minutes. Then I poured the sauce on them and baked them for an add'l 30 to 45 minutes. Make sure you baste the wings w/the sauce during baking. They were EXCELLENT!! Thanks, Tracy. "", "" I definitely suggest making this recipe without the egg, flour or frying. I don't like to fry food unless it is really necessary to improve the taste and in this case it isn't necessary and in my opinnion does not inprove taste. To make my chicken I used wings, cut them up and put them in a bowl. I then poured about 1-2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil on them and made sure all the wings had a light coating of oil. I then placed the wigs on a broiler pan and put them in the oven (set to broil) until the wings were brown on one side and then I browned the other side. This is much faster than frying, uses much less oil and is much healthier. I then put the wings in a baking dish with the sauce mixture from the recipe (I only used half a cup of sugar) and cooked them in the oven like the recipe says. This way tasted much better than frying (in my opinion). But also, this way, the wings are less crispy. If you want crispy wings you better fry them. "", ' WOW this recipe is awesome. I first tried it about 3 months ago and have been making it all the time since then. I did tweak it a little though-i placed the wings in a pan and sprinkled them generously with garlic powder and paprika-then sprayed them with pam. I baked them at 375 for 35 min-then i flipped them respiced them and baked them for another 25 min. After that i poured on the sauce and baked them another 20-25 min. I find this recipe very quick and easy and it is always a hit with my guests. You wont regret trying this recipe!! ', "" Awesome! I used only 1/2 of the sugar recipe calls for and used half white vinegar and half seasoned rice vinegar found in Asian markets. I tried 3 different cooking variations: 1)followed the recipe's cooking method using butter to fry in before putting it in the oven. This was good, but I felt the butter overpowered the goodness of the sauce -btw, I LOVE butter, but frying the wings in butter was a step you can definitely omit and save the calories on. 2) I followed reviewers suggestions and oven-fried. I coated with egg &amp; flour and baked @ 400 for 25 min turning once then added sauce and baked additional 30 min @ 350. This was by far the best. The skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was fabulous. 3) I coated with egg and panko flakes, baked @400 for 25 turning once, added sauce, baked addition 30 @350. This was also good and my second favorite. the panko really soaks up the sauce and gives the wing a more sweet-sticky coat then a crispy-sticky. so it depends on your taste. For all 3 variations, once the sauce was added (lined baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup), I turned the wings a few times and then removed the wings from the sauce and placed on fresh foil over baking sheet for the last 5 min.Can't wait to make it again! I forgot to add the sesame seeds like the pictures show and really wish I didn't. I'm sure the sesame seeds are a perfect touch.. "", "" Great recipe! i fried them because that's how wings should be done! If people want something healthier, than type salad in the search bar!

Instead of frying the wings i simply washed them, patted them dry, seasoned and put them under the broiler. I turned them over and over again and they end up very crispy. I then drained the fat and followed by adding the sauce. With the added corn starch, the sauce ends up very thick and rich Served it with coconut rice and grilled veggies. Amazing!

And that seemed to work out wonderfully. The cookie was a hit at a pot-luck! These do taste like cinnamon rolls! And they are very pretty with the cinnamon swirl. Try this! "", ' This is a great cookie! First off, I did not do the dollop either. I chilled the dough for 1 hour before rolling. Then rolled the dough out onto wax paper for easier rolling,using the wax paper to help me roll it without cracking the dough. After I let the filling cool and thicken, I used all of the filling in the roll . I used a whisk to help incorporate the butter better. I chilled the dough again for about an hour. Then cut the cookies with a sharp knife and baked on wax paper according to directions. I left them on the sheet for a couple of minutes then moved them to a rack to cool. They were very pretty and OMG they melt in your mouth! They retained their shape and looked like a cinnamon roll. I thought I would ice them, but found after tasting them uniced, they did not need anything else. Great with coffee or a nice cold glass of milk! ', "" These ROCK!! I had to use my egg substitue (which is a banana mashed with 1 tsp. of baking powder) for the 2 eggs and they still turned out fabulous! I suggest doubling the sugar spread. Instead of going through all of the trouble of flipping the cookie sheet and all that I just spread a dab on the top of each cookie and that worked great. I also had no problem with the spreading as I took Linda McClean's advice and put the dough in the fridge after I rolled it. Worked fine and I will seek that topping next time. YUM-YUM! Thanks Amber! "", "" These were truly delicious but the dollop of cinnamon mixture on the cookie sheet wasn't neccassary, as I couldn't tell a difference. I still did it with some though and they all were very good. These also get much flatter and double in size while baking, so if they look small and tall on your cookie sheet before you bake them, no worries! "", "" These are wonderful cookies! You need to have a glass of milk handy though because they are wonderfully sweet!! I used a VERY small amount of filling on my cookie sheets and didn't have any problem with them spreading. Also you may want to use a tip I learned a long time ago and use dental floss to actually cut the cookies into 1 inch sections. Dental floss works wonderfully for this type job! The glaze that another reviewer gave for the cookies was great too! Thanks Amber for a really super good cookie........I say ONE because that's all that I got once my husband and son got hold of them!!:) "", "" My daughters and I just finished baking our 600 Christmas cookies and this amazing cookie was a first for us. Oh my gosh the whole house took on the most wonderful smell and the taste was just as fantastic. I did put the dollop of the mixture on the pan and didn't have any problems with spreading. Maybe it was because I chilled my dough after rolling and filling. I like the idea of a sugar glaze but after baking so many cookies I'd had enough but I'll certainly try that next time.

"", "" Having moved away from home (and away from German cookie bakers) I decided to try making these for the first time and I'm happy to report that this recipe was great! The only thing that I changed was that I used a bit more citron and nuts than was called for and I used chopped pecans. Before baking I pressed a pecan half into the center of each cookie. Also I used a lemon glaze - something that I think is necessary. To make juice one lemon and add enough powdered sugar to make somewhat thick. Spread on when cookies are still hot from oven. In terms of stickiness this dough is quite sticky but it is definitely manageable. Make sure you chill it overnight and do not add a lot of flour into the dough as you roll.

I spent my childhood in Germany and Lebkuchen was always a favorite. These taste good and for taste I would give this probably 4-4.5 stars but the consistency is all wrong - MUCH too crisp and hard unlike what Lebkuchen is supposed to be which is almost cakey. The directions to roll these to 1/4"" is not right - if you roll to 1/2-3/4"" they turn out a lot better. I would also bake these a little less than called for these turned out much too hard. Better for cutting out gingerbread men or building a gingerbread house out of. The glaze also wasn\'t right - much too gloopy and sticky I ended up only doing the first batch and then throwing out the rest of the glaze - they are good plain or I might add some melted chocolate. I used the Back-Oblaten someone mentioned - the edible paper wafers as a base. I didn\'t have the problem with stickiness everyone else had if anything it came out of the fridge much too hard and I had to gently warm it to make it pliable and workable again although to be fair I added 1/4-1/2 cup more flour.

To sum up I think these need to be thicker baked less and possibly need more of a levening agent to get them cakier/softer. ', ' My mother made Lebkuchen every Christmas and gave it as gifts.

You might want to use a full cup of milk as suggested. If not they may not cook as well due to the fact that they are so fluffy! Make these up and your family will love you for it! "", "" This is the first time I made pancakes from scratch! They were great!! Per previous reviews I also used 5 tsp of cinnamon (one of my favorite spices) and 1 cup of milk. Turned out wonderfully! I can't wait to make these as gifts! "", "" I didn't bother making this for a jar I just went ahead and made a batch of this for the family this morning. I made the whole thing so I could have enough pancakes for a couple days. I had to play with the recipe a bit because it dosen't really come out right. The whole dry mix makes three cups of mix but the measurement of adding wet to dry asks for 1 1/3 cups of the dry which comes out to more than the recipe makes. I make pancakes a lot so I kind of knew what to use for the whole dry mix ingredients (two eggs two cups buttermilk 1/4 cup melted butter/vegetable oil two teaspoons vanilla). I used a mixture of whole wheat flour and AP flour buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I served these pancakes with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. We LOVED them. There's just enough leftover for a small two-boy breakfast tomorrow (or a midnight snack for the husband if he so chooses) which is good enough for me. I'll make this pancake recipe again using my changes. NOTE: Remember that this pancake batter will be thick--so don't panic and think you've messed up your pancakes. It's supposed to look like that. "", "" Prior to making these into gifts I decided to test the recipe myself and I'm glad I did. As other reviewers mentioned the batter was extremely thick. I did however try making a pancake before altering the original recipe to give the recipe the beneift of the doubt. It wasn't to my liking so I added approximately 1/4 cup of additional milk to the remaining batter. I made another pancake and decided to add a little vanilla approximately 1/2 teaspoon. As others have mentioned limiting the dry ingredients to 1 /4 cup to 1 cup milk would probably be the appropriate ratios for pancake batter. This would have been a 5 recipe if the dry/wet ratios were accurate. Otherwise great tasting pancake with maple syrup. My 4 year old came into the kitchen and asked if we were having cinnamon rolls. They smelled delicious while cooking. One more note: Why would you layer everything if you only use part of the mix to make batter? You force your gift recipient to use it all or mix it up themselves and put the remaining back in the jar. I am not layering this recipe and mixing it up before packaging it. Sure it is probably prettier by layering but just not practical with this recipe unless you plan to use the whole jar at once. "", ' Very good after modifications. I used 3 tbl. sugar 5 tsp. cinnamon and added dried apples. I too used 1 c milk. The first reviewer was correct this recipe doesn\'t measure out correctly. I added 1/2 c wheat flour the first time and that made it 3 equal batches. The second time however I added 1/2 cup dried apples instead. When I measured it out I got 3 batches using 1 1/4 cup mix. You don\'t need a full cup of milk doing it that way. I\'m selling these for Christmas this year. Hopefully they\'ll go like ""hot cakes""! ', ' Loved the cinnamon taste thanks for sharing.

I also ""made"" my own buttermilk by adding 1 T. apple cider vinegar to 1 c. milk and letting it set for a few minutes. I also used 1/4 c. cocoa powder in the cake as opposed to just 3 T.. Amazing recipe! ', "" I've never made the cake, but I have made the fudge icing and used it on other cakes. It is delicious and truly tastes like fudge. I would caution, however, that you do not beat it for the full 3 minutes if you intend to pour it over your cake (I like it poured over bundt cake). It will not flow down the sides but rather sit on the top in more of a clump. Stop beating when it looks a little thinner than what you want because it will set very fast. "", "" After reading the reviews I decided to make a few small changes and made this a 5 star recipe (well at least to me). I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead of the 3T and an extra tsp of vanilla. Also I didn't have buttermilk so I added a tsp of vinegar to a cup of regular milk. The icing was very yummy even though I burnt it while boiling. I saved it by just pouring off the good stuff and not scaping the bottom of the pot. Also I only beat it for 2 min and didn't have any problems with it being too thick. SUPER DUPER and very moist! "", ' This cake is divine! So moist and tasty. Do not skip the frosting step, it compliments the cake perfectly - it is just not the same cake without it. I have made this cake several times and it has been consistently successful. Just a couple of suggestions: I use a little over 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, instead of 3 tbls. Do not burn your frosting. Properly butter and flour your pan beforehand (I use a 9X13 pan). Do NOT overbake. Take out while still slightly moist on the toothpick (not clean like the recipe says). I shut off oven and let the cake sit in for 5 min max after the slighly moist point. and ENJOY!!! ', "" The cake wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best that I've had. It was moist as other users have said but you would definitely want to add more cocoa..I used 1/4 cup..I would also recommend sifting the flour before use or use cake flour. "", "" Flavor is excellent. I only gave it 4 stars however because I want more frosting. I took a photo which shows how the frosting doesn't cover the entire cake. Sure it is rich and sweet... but I like chocolate cake that way! The more the better!! I did follow someone else's suggestion of using 1/4 Cup of Cocoa for the cake batter and am glad I did. Now I'm off to make another batch of frosting - yum! - "", "" This recipe is fantastic! Every chocolate cake I've ever made has come out dry but this one was perfect! and so easy! I beat it by hand not with a mixer and used a chocolate buttercream frosting. Ummmm! good! But beware you'll be coming back for 2nds and 3rds and it is sinfully rich and so delicious! Nana Betty "", "" I haven't made the cake but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the icing. It's a great way to make a boxed cake mix taste homemade! My family (4boys hubby) eat it all in one sitting. Thanks!! "", ' I bake A LOT and I followed this recipe exactly but I will not make this cake again. I\'m unsure why it has gotten such good reviews. Perhaps people have never had a really good piece of chocolate cake before. I\'ll give it 2 stars because it didn\'t taste ""bad"" but I think there are things wrong with the recipes for both the cake and the frosting. The cake definitely needed more cocoa powder. Also the texture was strange when it had finished baking. Part of the problem may lie with the method in which it is mixed and it that it is a fairly runny batter. By itself I didn\'t care for the cake at all. The fudge topping has a good flavor but unless you like to crunch on granules of sugar it should be cooked differently. The sugar needs a chance to dissolve. Fudge should be smooth not crystallized. I think the problem may be that it needs more liquid perhaps some corn syrup. I am going to look for another chocolate cake recipe. In all seriousness the ones out of the box are better. Sorry but this one is definitely not worth the time.

Served it over organic spinach fetuccini with spicy italian sausage sliced on top. Beautiful meal! "", ' This sauce has a great flavor to it--sweet but not cloying. I must concur with other reviewers: the consistency is a bit too thin. I suspect this could be thickened without sacrificing too much flavor by adding flour according to taste. Flour is usually an ingredient in cream sauces, but is absent from this particular recipe. Spices and tomatoes may need to be increased if flour is added, but the sauce should become satisfactorily viscous. I suggest adding flour in small quantities, being cautious not to use too much.

Delicious, served over mini penne pasta and shredded parmesan. Wish I had grilled chicken to go over top. One complaint: this really only made enough for 3 servings, no way 5 unless this was for a side dish. Thank you. "", ' This has become my staple sauce since I first discovered it on this site. I have made it a countless number of times now, both as per recipe for a small scale, and slightly altered for a much larger scale. Regardless, I always use more garlic than called for and always run the whole thing through the blender to smooth the sauce. This is absolutely delicious and always receives rave reviews. Quick, easy, and foolproof - what more could you ask for? ', "" WOW! What a great sauce! So here's what I did...like another member, after cooking tomatoes, onion, garlic and spices in saucepan, I put mixture into blender and pureed. Then I put back into saucepan, stirred in 3/4 cup nonfat milk (in place of heavy cream) and butter. I left out sugar altogether. Didn't need it. I added a small amount of grated parmesan cheese to give it an extra kick. What I got was a sauce that tasted like it was full of fat and calories, but it was actually almost fat free and very healthy! Not to mention, it was EXTREMELY easy to make. Definitely a keeper! "", ' sauteed onions, mushrooms, garlic and red pepper, then added tomatoes, brought to a boil..... Then I pureed the whole thing in blender. My family has yet to know off these added, rarely eaten (by them) veggies........I replaced fat free half-n-half for heavy whipping cream (as I do most things, too much fat &amp; calories for us) and added fresh grated Parmaggiano cheese! The sugar is important (altho I use Splenda) to help take adge off the tomato taste. Was yummy and very creamy! ', "" This was a great sauce for our pasta. I didn't have any Italian diced tomatoes so I just used regular and added italian seasoning. Also, didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I used 3/4 of a cup of whole milk and 1/3 cup of butter. I added red pepper flakes (husband likes it hot) and a little all-purpose flour to thicken and it was wonderful. Will definitely make again! "", "" Ok, I have made this twice now.

However, to indulge my wife\'s Mother\'s recipe I made couple of addtions in ingredients as well as sequence steps: Within the celery volume I added cellery leaves. I added 1/2 cup of minced parsley. I shortened the drying time by first toasting all the bread to a light brown color...and then placing the slices in a large casserole dish in the microwave on a medium setting for 5 minutes. Then repeating it as needed until the bread was rigid when the microwave power was interrupted by opening the door and checking. That saved the 24hr drying time and brought it down into about 20 minutes. I did not use a rolling pin to crush the bread into total crumbs, but crushed it by hand until there were crumbs and pieces in the bowl. Pieces were never larger than the average thumbnail and there were a lot of crumbs. After placing the crushed bread in a bowl, add the dry ingredient-spices and thoroughly mix them together before adding the eggs and chicken broth. Then mix the eggs and chicken broth together before adding to the crumb-spice mixture. Then add the results of the sauted onion-celery mix without draining it. Add more water if needed at this point so the resultant stuffing is moist and clumps together, but is not a mushy mess. Four family traditions loved it!! ', ' Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!

However, the can of cherry filling I had in the cupboard didn\'t have enough for what I like. So, I ended up adding about a layer of mixed frozen berries on top of the cherry filling and patting them down into the filling goo. Adding the frozen berries was a good idea; it cut down on the ""canned"" feeling of the crisp. Omitted nutmeg, used real butter, sub\'d walnuts for pecans. ', ' Very tasty and EASY dessert.

We love this recipe, but we also change it a little by adding freshly minced garlic and some asiago along with the romano and parmesan. This stuff is so good we dip our bread into it! ', "" This sauce was a big hit at a dinner party I had, but I did make a few changes. I minced some garlic and sautéed it in the butter on low heat before adding the cream. TIP: if you're concerned the sauce is too soupy, just continue to slowly stir the sauce (for about ten minutes) on low heat after adding the cheese - it will thicken up to perfection. Before adding the sauce to the pasta (along with scallops, shrimp and broccoli) I was a bit concerned about the flavor. I had tasted the sauce from the pan and it was much too salty. I had only added a dash of garlic salt and a dash of table salt, so I couldn't figure what I might have done wrong. My only thought was that I neglected to use unsalted butter, but the recipe hadn't specified. Anyhow, once combined with the pasta, etc., the sauce tasted perfect. I'm sure much of the salty flavor was a result of the cheese, but you can't go wrong with Romano and Parmesan. Next time I will mince/sauté a bit more garlic and I will hold off on the garlic/table salt. I adjusted the servings to feed 12 people, which required 4 sticks of butter. Maybe next time I'll use 2 unsalted and 2 salted sticks, but as I said, once combined with the pasta, the sauce tasted wonderful. "", "" i chose this recipe because it had the best reviews. and it really is very very good. i scaled down the recipe to 4 servings, but beware because the pasta it calls for is WAY too much, especially if you like a lot of sauce. my recommendation is to make the sauce according to this recipe's scale but make the amount of pasta according to the pasta box/label. i also love garlic in my alfredo so i minced about 5 cloves of garlic and added it to the sauce. also make sure that you are watching the sauce at all times and stirring often because the sauce tends to stick at the bottom and curdle there. also added chicken strips sauteed in butter and lawry's garlic salt, which added the saltiness the dish needed, since i made the sauce a little more on the bland side. i made it once with margarine and half and half to skim calories but it does not turn out that well. it tends to congeal and is not as creamy or thick so if you're looking to skim calories, this is not the recipe to do it with. my husband who is obsessed with alfredo thinks it is the best he's ever had. we love alfredo and thought olive garden had the best, but now we will be making this at home. very simple recipe, and love that all the ingredients are so accessible, and doesn't require an egg! "", "" I am writing a review of my own recipe in response to some of the reviews... ...So that everyone knows, this is an authentic Italian (Olive Garden is NOT Italian) recipe for Fettuccine Alfredo, therefore, it doesn't have garlic.

Erin "", ' Pretty good - very similar to Olive Garden. Best thing besides taste is that this recipe has no egg in it! Good even without the parmesean added at the end. If you have leftovers and the butter separates, add more cream before heating and stir after heating - it will be just like when it was fresh. Be careful of this stuff though - sauce is extremely fattening!!! Great as a once in a while treat.

Lastly the cheese I used was Fontina (it was on sale!) instead of Gouda still mixed with the mozzarella cheese. With all of these alterations...it was magnificent!!

A very sweet pie, nice appearance, and make sure to top it off with whipped cream. This recipe is by far a 5 star!! Tips: I did not use the ginger nor the nutmeg; instead I added 2 teaspoons of ""McCormik\'s Pumpkin Pie Spice"" (which includes: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, and Allspice), along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon. So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it. If you like a lot of cinnamon, that\'s the way to go. For me, I preferred 1 teaspoon, but I\'d eat it either way. Thanks EAGLE BRAND® ', "" I have never made pumpkin pie before...us Australians don't eat pumpkin pie.

I wonder if i should go down the street and buy another butternut pumpkin and make one more before Christmas Day...they say practise makes perfect lol. We don't have tinned pumpkin or pumpkin spice over here so I have to do everything myself...but maybe that makes it even nicer. "", "" The easiest and best pumpkin pie I've ever made. I followed a suggestion that someone else had made and used 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2tsp of ground cinnamon instead. The bottom of my crust was still a tad underdone so I would suggest pre-baking the crust for a bit. "", ' This is a very tasty, traditional pumpkin pie. I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture. Also, if you are using a homemade pie crust, I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling. Otherwise, the crust will get mushy. I cooked my pie for almost an hour (cooking time varies)and then, cooked for 15 minutes on the very bottom rack to finish the cooking of my crust while also lightly browing the top of the pie. You end up with a perfectly spiced product, perfect with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner (or anytime you crave it!). ', "" This recipe was awesome !!! Stick with the other reviewers tips and us 2 teaspoons of McCormick's Pumkin spice instead of ginger and nutmeg, I also added one teaspoon of cinnamon and warmed up the spices and pumkin on the stove on low heat, cooling than adding the eggs and sweetened milk, it really made the spices meld together great like the other reviewer said to do. I have NEVER baked before and was able to make this recipe just perfect. **TIP**- Where it says bake 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees....take my advice and try this- bake it at 350 degrees (after you've done step 1 on directions of course) Bake it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, than turn off your oven and set your timer for 5 minutes while you let the pie sit in there, this way it will still cook for an additional few minutes while the oven is off but still hot and this way the oven will cool enough so that you can let the pie cool off on the top rack the remainder of the time. Doing this will prevent the pie from cracking when it hits the cool air of the counter when it's still very warm. I topped it off with cool wip and graham cracker crumbs, great texture....Thanks EAGLE BRAND!!! "", "" Absolutely delicious and the only recipe I ever use. I do add my own twist to this recipe, though. Firstly, I heat the canned pumpkin and spices on medium heat for a few minutes, to get rid of the canned flavor. Secondly, I use 2 teaspoons of McCormick's pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I use one and a half 14 oz cans of condensed milk (I love that sweet, rich flavor - the extra condensed milk really adds an outstanding richness to this) instead of just one can, and 3 medium eggs (to compensate for the extra liquid). Even with the extra half can of milk, the filling fits in a standard 9 inch pie crust (I use a store-bought crust). I bake at 450 F for 20 minutes, and then I cover the top of the pie with aluminum foil, and then bake at 325 F for 1 hour. I then switch off the oven and let the pie cool in the oven for an hour, before I refrigerate it. Tenting with aluminum foil while baking prevents the crust from getting burnt, and letting the pie cool in the oven ensures that the top does not sink and that the center is cooked. This pie tastes best when made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight - this gives the flavors a chance to blend. I have forgotten to add salt before, and not noticed any difference. I have always received rave reviews about this - this recipe is a keeper ! "", ' Very good pie. I always have soggy crust so I Bake the crust a tad before putting the filling in, I also let the pie cool in the oven. I also like it a bit spicier so a little extra spice makes it extra well for me (I like ground cloves in mine as well). I make extra filling and overfill deeper pans and bake the extra filling in oven with the pies for that special taste for the cook. Maple syrup also adds real nice flavor. How I make it depends on my mood. Often I make several and make one spicy and one not for different taste to please all. ', ' Not impressed. I followed the recipe to the letter. A thick skin developed on top of the pie that ballooned in the oven. The end result looked like a shar pei. The pumpkin itself was mild in taste and over baked.

And instead of 1 cup of cream, I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of milk; I found it a little too thick with straight cream. I left out the almond extract (simply because I'm not a big fan) and increased the vanilla a little bit. I also reduced the whiskey by a third, so you should spike to taste.

', "" I've been making this Irish Cream for 2 years now and give them out as gifts in mass quantities. (48-60 bottles per Christmas). It has gotten tremendous raves from all. While I am not a big tweaker of recipes, I have a few tiny changes that seem to have been a hit. First of all, I use only Jameson Irish Whiskey.. the most important ingredient. I use a cup and a half. As for the extracts, I only us the real stuff, not imitation. A full teaspoon of vanilla and no more than 3/4th of the almond. For the sweetened condensed milk, only carnation will give the best results. The mix is very thick, and I usually also add an ounce of two or half and half, but the full cup of heavy cream is absolutely necessary. Lastly, I am generous with the chocolate syrup. 2 generous tablespoons. For the coffee, folgers decaf. (I know, theres plenty of caffeine already in this drink, but the folgers decaff gives a nicer overall flavor) These ingredients make this an expensive drink, but you will find that most of the people who taste it will tell you its the absolute best irish cream they ever had!! (Note, other recipes call for eggs in the mix.. which is totally not necessary) Good luck, I promise you will find this the best recipe you can find for genuine irish cream. "", "" I've made this three times: the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter. It was good, but I thought it was too much whiskey and too much almond flavoring. The second time I cut the whiskey to 1 cup, and the almond flavoring to just under 1/4 tsp. That was much better. The third time, I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just added 1 cup of skim milk, and I think it was the best batch yet. The heavy cream makes it really thick, almost like a milkshake. Skim milk of course thins it, but you get the same amount of creaminess (I think) and less calories. This stuff is best after it's been in the refrigerator overnight--the flavors are fully blended. Great stuff! "", ' Nobody has mentioned the fact that when cream &amp; whiskey are mixed, the cream separates. I lost about 1/3 of my recipe having to strain it off. Does anyone have any ideas how to overcome this? ', "" This recipe is SO good and SOO incredibly easy!! The only thing I changed was to use half and half.

We had someone give this to us for Christmas and included the recipe. ', "" Very enjoyable and was fun to make for gift-giving! I did find it way too strong for my taste(and my SO, too), so I ended up doubling the recipe to reduce the whiskey.

As a note, I made with boneless short ribs and they kind of fell apart they were so tender, which was perfect over teh mashed potatos....reminds me of something you might get in a soul food restaurant down in the south, oddly....A must try!!! oh and have your butcher at your grocery store trim all the fat off of the short ribs ahead of time, takes them about a minute and cuts down on the fat...I had no fat buildup by doing this...they do it for free, you just have to ask!

I also followed the advice of several reviewers: First, I combined the flour/starch mixture with the breadcrumbs. It was a huge time-saver and didn't seem to impact the end result. I also tried both double &amp; triple coating and found that a double coat was sufficient for my taste. When the batter got a little clumpy, I simply moulded the clumps around the cheese for a slightly thicker coat. This part was a little messy, but other than that, it wasn't too bad. I coated all of the sticks before frying and set them aside on a plate. This turned out to be great advice because the frying really only takes about 30 seconds, and if you turn your back for too long, the sticks will burn.

Here is what I do: Cut the cheese sticks in half this makes them easier to work with. Mix the flour with the bread crumbs and nix the cornstarch, dip the cheese in plain flour first to help the egg stick, then dip in crumbs, eggs again, then again in breadcrumbs/flour mix you will have a nice thick coating on them. Place them on a baking sheet covered in wax paper as you assemble them, then when you finish place the the tray in the freezer for about 30 minutes! (This is KEY! This keeps the cheese from melting the second it hits the oil and allows the coating to get crisp first) The recipe is pretty good as is, but if you make them as stated they will turn out a big mess!

There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There's already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You'll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon. "", "" Excellent and Authentic recipe! A little more work and ingredients, but well worth it. Use FRESH basil for more flavor - I use about 1/2 - 2/3 cup fresh chopped basil. It cooks down and is sooo aromatic. The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt. I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!). I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity. Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people. Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles. Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min. Noodles won't be cooked but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven. I learned this from a caterer - try it! "", "" I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant. This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions. As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients. You also do not need to cook the sauce. Sounds bizarre, but it's true. If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required. For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes. I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top. Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour. It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work. Fantastic recipe! "", "" WOW! This really is World's Best Lasagna! From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. SIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don't like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that's why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don't use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it's just plain nasty! "", "" I've convinced 3 (now-ex) boyfriends, my husband, and even a couple Italian friends at school that I make the most incredible lasagna they've ever tasted with this recipe. I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce. Everything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well. "", ' I read all the reviews and really followed ""Cookerbob""\'s advise. Here\'s what I changed: used 1 lb. LEAN gr. beef tripled the garlic reduced sugar to 1 T. reduced salt to 1 t. used 9 lasagna noodles per pan and used 1 pound mozzarella (shredded) cheese per pan. I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6 hours. Sounds like a lot of work but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna so that\'s what I did. Made 2 baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever. I totally agree! ', "" I was so disappointed with this lasagna! I won't be using this recipe again. With such a high rating, I thought it would taste better. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you'd buy in the freezer section at the grocery store.

"", "" I quadrupled this recipe for 32 men, and it went over so well ... they came back for seconds, and asked for the recipe for their wives ... now how many men do you know that ask for a recipe? I made a few changes to this recipe based on past reviews and am glad I did ... here are my suggestons ... use fresh whole wheat lasagna noodles (found in the deli dept.) ... no need to cook them and they come in sheets ... make 3 layers for lasagna dish ... therefore, you would require 8 fresh lasagna sheets ... I had to read through a lot of reviews to figure out what to do with the italian sausage, as it doesn't explan in the recipe how to cook that ... what you do is buy mild italian sausages (couldn't find sweet italian sausage and I understand through most reviews that most people can't) ... you then remove the casing around the sausage, remove the meat and fry the meat until cooked in a frying pan ... instead of using 1 tbsp. salt in the sauce, I used 1 tsp. ... and it was perfect ... I suggest going with your taste ... same thing with the sugar ... go with your personal taste ... the layers were a little difficult to figure out so here is what works ... make 3 layers ... first layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... 2nd layer is meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture (add a little nutmeg for taste), parmesan cheese ... 3rd layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... defiitely add the fennel seeds ... gives great f "", "" This was very good. It didn't fit in my 9 x 13 pan, but worked out fine by placing part of the ingredients in a loaf pan. Caution: skip the tablespoon of salt! (Have you EVER heard of a recipe that calls for a full tablespoon?) Between the cheeses and the canned tomato products, no additional salt was needed. This recipe would easily be a base for your favorite additions: spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Other reviewers were absolutely correct: plan to make this the day before serving. It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors and incredible taste. I served this with homemade cheese bread and a crisp green salad. "", "" I am giving this 5 stars b/c all of my friends liked it and asked me for the recipe! I made this for my women's group holiday dinner. I would personally give it 4 stars. It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn't seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don't like ricotta anyways). I followed a couple reviewer's suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering. I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm). I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine). Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn't find it). Be sure to use fresh parsley. It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won't get from the dried stuff. Also, be sure to add fennel seed. It really adds nice flavor to the dish. Leftovers were yummy. I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square. My dad ate the other 4! This one's a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts.

Exactly the same except with more tasty stuff in it. ', "" I really enjoyed this. I had a family member over for dinner who didn't like mushrooms, so I left them out and used diced cucumber instead. I also chopped kalamata olives. I tried cutting back on the oil, because it looked like a lot, but I would use the full amount next time I make it. It might also benefit from using a little lemon juice in place of some of the vinegar, but all around really good as is. Thanks Kelly. "", ' Very good base recipe. I read some of the other reviews and followed what they did. I made this for a corporate luncheon for 40 people. I substituted a few things. I used cheese tortelini red onions instead of green onions added some green peppers and reduced the amount of mushrooms and used pitted kalamata olives instead of canned black olives. It got rave reviews. People were scooping it into paper cups to take home. Definitely one to make again and try more variations. ', "" I run a small catering business with my sister and we've used this recipe twice now - both times we rec'd rave reviews. The only thing I do differently is use fresh spices as opposed to dried - really kicks up the flavor! "", ' I was out of red wine vinegar so I subbed in balsamic and my guests loved it! ', "" Ok so I changed this recipe so much that it barely looks like the original. But I had to review it because I got such great ideas from the recipe and the other reviewers. I added just about everything I could find in my fridge: artichoke hearts sun-dried tomatoes olives pepperoni pepperoncini peppers cucumber red onion diced pimentos and a few shreds of leftover carrot. With all the additions it made the biggest batch of pasta salad I have ever seen but I have no doubt that we will finish it in a few days. I did stick with just 8 oz of pasta and that was enough for my huge batch. And I only added 1/3 c each of red wine vinegar and EVOO. I probably could add a touch more vinegar but overall this is awesome! I can't get enough of this salad! "", "" I didn't have time to make up the desssing so instead I just used Kraft Greek With Fetta and Oregano dressing. Really tasty. Added a bunch of chopped garlic as well as a little red onion a yellow pepper and a cubed cucumber. Really any combo of fresh crip veggies would go though probably. "", "" This was fabulous! The seasonings work well together; this is so much better than any pasta salad I've ever made. The only things I changed were to reduce the amount of vinegar and oil to 1/4 cup each and the seasonings to 1 tsp each. Otherwise it makes too much dressing. Also I don't like mushrooms so I used cucumber and orange bell pepper instead. Delicious! "", "" Amazing salad! It's definitely one you can cater to your own personal tastes - I used balsamic vinegar cut down on the oil and vinegar to 1/4 c. each used artichoke hearts and omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them raw. It turned out fabulous! ""]",https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23616

What I did was use a carton of mushrooms a bunch of green onions a whole green and red pepper a few stalks of celery with the inner stalks and tops a frozen bag of peas and a bag of broccoli (thawed). Next time I would use fresh not frozen broccoli that\'s what helped turn it to mush. Some crunch would be nice. Omitted the ham. Added some pepper. Using 8 oz. of spaghetti this amount of veggies was plenty it\'s just the consistency that needs to be worked on. I hate to say adding heavy cream might do it but then it\'s not something you would eat every day. ', "" Ok this is really good. With some changes. The amount of pasta is way to little I used about a pound of pasta. The cream cheese needs to be softened before you put it in the pan. It will incorporate much easier. I added extra milk since it was really thick as is. I also added minced garlic zucchini fresh mushrooms instead of canned carrot sticks onions and tomatoes. I didn't have any red bell pepper so I just used green. And since I added extra milk I used extra parm. I topped it with diced tomatoes and green onions. Very tasty recipe. Thanks. "", "" I gave this a 4 because it truly does need a lot of revisions--I used a ton more vegetables--a 16 oz package of frozen broccoli cauliflower and carrots a cup of frozen peas a cup of frozen green beans half of a fresh red pepper a can of mushrooms--and a pound of angel hair pasta. So I cooked the vegetables in some canola oil and made the sauce in a seperate pan and boiled the pasta in a seperate pan. I also added garlic and onion to the vegetable mixture and the sauce. Also I added basil and oregano to the sauce too. So the cream cheese idea is a good base but you definitely need to jazz the recipe up a bit. Also I don't see the need for all the butter--I used about 1 tbsp of canola oil to saute my veggies and they were delicious! And I cannot even IMAGINE this sauce on 4 oz. of pasta because we had enough for 1 lb of pasta--but if you like a lot of sauce you may want to use about 3/4 of a pound of pasta. Overall--good base of a recipe just need to add a lot more stuff--but in the end it's great! "", ' The sauce was far too pasty. It would be better with half the cream cheese. ', ' It was really good!! The sauce came out great. I used fresh mushrooms and skipped the ham so I had to season it more. I added minced garlic and cilantro and I was glad I did--added a little kick. ', "" this will be one of those reviews where you'll wonder why i bothered since i really didn't make this recipe but thought i'd share anyway. i basically had the same ingredients on hand as the reviewer caliloo so i followed her advice. i sauteed a little shallot garlic and onion along with par-microwaved carrots asparagus broccoli and squash. i only had about half a block of cream cheese so i cut down on the milk. and i used some leftover rotisserie chicken. i salt and peppered it threw in some red pepper flakes and dried basil (might leave that one out next time) and used extra parm. it turned out pretty well; i think a little white wine would be good in there and as well as shrimp if you have it.
